Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in the [Materials Science and Engineering](https://www.mse.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} (MSE) department at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I am advised by [Mark Asta](https://www.mse.berkeley.edu/ourfaculty/astam){:target="_blank"} and my research is broadly in the domain of **computational structural materials**, leveraging the power of atomistic simulations and machine learning (ML) to inform alloy design.

Here is my <a href="enze-chen.github.io/files/resume_enze.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> for a one-page summary. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/enze-chen){:target="_blank"} and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enzechen/){:target="_blank"}.

## Research projects

### UC Berkeley
This is just kicking off! Check back for more information.

### Sandia National Laboratories
During the summer of 2018, I was a R&D Intern at [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/){:target="_blank"} in Albuquerque, NM. I worked in the [Center for Computing Research](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/index.cfm){:target="_blank"} in the Multiscale Science Department (Org. 1444). My mentors were [John Mitchell](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/templates/insert/profile.cfm?jamitch){:target="_blank"} and [Jay Lofstead](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/templates/insert/profile.cfm?gflofst){:target="_blank"}, and I assisted in the development of a new I/O (Input/Output) system that drastically reduces the computational resource requirements of large-scale additive manufacturing simulations in [SPPARKS](https://spparks.sandia.gov/){:target="_blank"}.


### Citrine Informatics
During the summer of 2017, I was a Data Science and Engineering intern at [Citrine Informatics](https://citrine.io){:target="_blank"} in Redwood City, CA. My mentors were Erin Antono, Jo Hill, and Bryce Meredig. I worked on three projects during this summer. The first was data engineering related and involved scraping and cleaning data to construct a dataset of polymer properties. The second was an internal data science research project on structural features for ML predictions of material properties. The third was in collaboration on a customer project that used ML to identify organic semiconducting materials with high mobility (presented at [MRS Spring 2019 GI01.07.02](https://www.mrs.org/spring2019/symposium-sessions/symposium-sessions-detail?code=GI01){:target="_blank"}).


### Stanford University
Starting in the summer of 2016, I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the [Materials Theory and Computation Group](https://reedgroup.stanford.edu/index.html){:target="_blank"} at Stanford University. My mentors were [Qian Yang](http://www.qianyanglab.com/){:target="_blank"} (now at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/){:target="_blank"}) and [Evan Reed](https://reedgroup.stanford.edu/staff/evanreed.html){:target="_blank"}. My research used [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics){:target="_blank"} (MD) simulations and ML to study the chemical kinetics of hydrocarbon decomposition under extreme conditions. Specifically, I demonstrated that a ML model trained on isobutane (C4H10) decomposition could be used to accurately predict the reactions and species in methane (CH4) decomposition in mere minutes without the need to run another MD simulation that would take weeks. This work on chemical extrapolation has since been communicated at an oral presentation at [MRS Fall 2017 TC04.08.08](https://www.mrs.org/fall2017-symposium-sessions?Code=TC04){:target="_blank"}, in a [**first-author** publication](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpca.8b09947){:target="_blank"} in [*The Journal of Physical Chemistry A*](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/jpcafh){:target="_blank"}, and in a [co-authored book chapter](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-05600-1_9){:target="_blank"} in [*Computational Approaches for Chemistry Under Extreme Conditions*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-030-05600-1){:target="_blank"}.


### Washington University in St. Louis
My first exposure to the world of materials science came as a high school summer intern in 2012 in the [Soft Nanomaterials Laboratory](https://softnano.wustl.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My mentors were [Limei Tian](https://engineering.tamu.edu/biomedical/profiles/tian-limei.html){:target="_blank"} (now at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/){:target="_blank"}) and [Srikanth Singamaneni](https://engineering.wustl.edu/Profiles/Pages/Srikanth-Singamaneni.aspx){:target="_blank"}. My research involved synthesizing gold nanorods and characterizing shifts in their localized surface plasmon resonance spectra based on their dimensions and changes in their local environment. This work has been communicated in a [co-authored publication](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la3034534){:target="_blank"} in [*Langmuir*](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/langd5){:target="_blank"}.

## Education
After high school in the Midwest (St. Louis, MO), I have been fortunate enough to call the Bay Area home for the past five years and counting. Of course, you can imagine that [Big Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Game_(American_football)){:target="_blank"} is a tough test of loyalties.

### Cooking
I love to cook! Most experience comes from Chinese food. Learning how to bake, but tough for someone who doesn't like to follow recipes (dal cuore).

### Aquatic sports
Ladue High School and [St. Louis Area Polo](http://www.leagueathletics.com/?org=stlouisareapolo) (SLAP). Stanford Club Water Polo.

### Books, movies, and musicals
Finally, if I'm not doing one of the above activities, you will probably find me enjoying these forms of entertainment. I don't think my tastes for each medium are in and of themselves peculiar, but their combination might be. Always happy to take and prioritize any suggestions!

* **Books**: I love to read the genres of non-fiction, memoirs, and world literature (both fiction and non-fiction).
    * 5 most recent titles: [Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3367956-hotel-on-the-corner-of-bitter-and-sweet), [Tuesdays with Morrie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6900.Tuesdays_with_Morrie), [Educated](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133922-educated), [10% Happier](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18505796-10-happier), [Becoming](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38746485-becoming).
* **Movies**: I love to watch rom-coms (shameless), animated films (particularly anime, but also Disney/Dreamworks), and documentaries. I've also only recently discovered indie films and want to view more in this genre.
    * 5 most recent titles: [One Child Nation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8923482/), [The Big Easy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092654/), [Moonstruck](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093565), [Dangal](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5074352/), [The Farewell](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8637428/).
* **Musicals**: I love musicals and showtunes! I've seen live and movie adaptations for about 30 so far, but who's counting?
