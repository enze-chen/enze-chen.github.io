Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in the Materials Science and Engineering ([MSE](https://www.mse.berkeley.edu/)) department at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). I am advised by [Mark Asta](https://www.mse.berkeley.edu/ourfaculty/astam) and my research is broadly in the domain of **computational structural materials**, leveraging the power of atomistic simulations and machine learning to inform alloy design.
