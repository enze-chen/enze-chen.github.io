## Research projects

### UC Berkeley
For my PhD, I am interested in using atomistic simulations and machine learning (ML) to understand the mechanical behavior of alloys to improve computational materials design. 


### Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)
For Summer 2020, I will be a Materials and Chemistry Institute (MaCI) intern at [LLNL](https://www.llnl.gov/){:target="_blank"} in Livermore, CA. I will be working in the [Computational Materials Science Group](https://pls.llnl.gov/people/divisions/materials-science-division/computational-materials-science-group){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of [Timofey Frolov](https://pls.llnl.gov/people/staff-bios/msd/frolov-t){:target="_blank"}.


### Stanford University
Starting in summer 2016 and continuing until my graduation, I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the [Materials Theory and Computation Group](https://reedgroup.stanford.edu/index.html){:target="_blank"} at Stanford University. My mentors were [Qian Yang](http://www.qianyanglab.com/){:target="_blank"} (now Asst. Prof. at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/){:target="_blank"}) and Prof. [Evan Reed](https://reedgroup.stanford.edu/staff/evanreed.html){:target="_blank"}. My research used [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics){:target="_blank"} (MD) simulations and ML to study the chemical kinetics of hydrocarbon decomposition under extreme conditions. Specifically, I demonstrated that a ML model trained on isobutane (C4H10) decomposition could be used to accurately predict the reactions and species in methane (CH4) decomposition in mere minutes without the need to run another MD simulation that would take weeks. This work on chemical extrapolation has since been communicated at my oral presentation at [MRS Fall 2017 TC04.08.08](https://www.mrs.org/fall2017-symposium-sessions?Code=TC04){:target="_blank"}, in a [**first-author** publication](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpca.8b09947){:target="_blank"} in [*The Journal of Physical Chemistry A*](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/jpcafh){:target="_blank"}, and in a [co-authored book chapter](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-05600-1_9){:target="_blank"} in [*Computational Approaches for Chemistry Under Extreme Conditions*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-030-05600-1){:target="_blank"}.


### Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)
During the summer of 2018, I was a R&D Intern at [SNL](https://www.sandia.gov/){:target="_blank"} in Albuquerque, NM. I worked in the [Center for Computing Research](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/index.cfm){:target="_blank"} in the Multiscale Science Department (Org. 1444). My mentors were [John Mitchell](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/templates/insert/profile.cfm?jamitch){:target="_blank"} and [Jay Lofstead](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/templates/insert/profile.cfm?gflofst){:target="_blank"}, and I assisted in the development of a new I/O (Input/Output) system that drastically reduces the computational resource requirements of large-scale additive manufacturing simulations in [SPPARKS](https://spparks.sandia.gov/){:target="_blank"}. We have a forthcoming publication in the proceedings of [*IPDPS 2020*](http://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2020/2020-.html){:target="_blank"}.


### Citrine Informatics
During the summer of 2017, I was a Data Science and Engineering intern at [Citrine Informatics](https://citrine.io){:target="_blank"}, a company headquartered in Redwood City, CA that specializes in using ML to accelerate materials science R&D. My mentors were Erin Antono, Jo Hill, and [Bryce Meredig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bmeredig/){:target="_blank"}. I worked on three projects during this summer. The first was data engineering related and involved scraping and cleaning data to construct a dataset of polymer properties. The second was an internal data science research project on structural features for ML predictions of material properties. The third was in collaboration on a customer project that used ML to identify organic semiconducting materials with high mobility (presented at [MRS Spring 2019 GI01.07.02](https://www.mrs.org/spring2019/symposium-sessions/symposium-sessions-detail?code=GI01){:target="_blank"}).


### Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL)
My first exposure to the world of materials science came as a part of the [STARS](http://www.umsl.edu/~sep/STARS/index.html){:target="_blank"} summer program in 2012 in the [Soft Nanomaterials Laboratory](https://softnano.wustl.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [WUSTL](https://wustl.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My mentors were [Limei Tian](https://engineering.tamu.edu/biomedical/profiles/tian-limei.html){:target="_blank"} (now Asst. Prof. at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/){:target="_blank"}) and Prof. [Srikanth Singamaneni](https://engineering.wustl.edu/Profiles/Pages/Srikanth-Singamaneni.aspx){:target="_blank"}. My research involved synthesizing gold nanorods and characterizing shifts in their localized surface plasmon resonance spectra based on their dimensions and changes in their local environment. This work has been communicated in a [second-author publication](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la3034534){:target="_blank"} in [*Langmuir*](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/langd5){:target="_blank"}.

## Other interests

### STEM education
In addition to MSE, another passion of mine is STEM education, particularly curriculum design and learning theory. During my undergrad, I took classes through the [Stanford Graduate School of Education](https://ed.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} (GSE) with [Jo Boaler](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/joboaler){:target="_blank"} and [Jennifer Wolf](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/jlwolf){:target="_blank"}, and lived in the [Education and Society Theme](http://web.stanford.edu/group/resed/cgi-bin/govco/east/){:target="_blank"} (EAST) House. I was also actively engaged in teaching opportunities through teaching with [Stanford Splash](https://github.com/enze-chen/splash_classes){:target="_blank"}, writing a [new coursereader](https://github.com/enze-chen/mse_142_cr){:target="_blank"} for the core undergraduate quantum mechanics class ([MATSCI 142](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=matsci142&collapse=){:target="_blank"}), and working as a TA for hundreds of students in Vadim Khayms's [undergraduate math classes](https://github.com/enze-chen/stanford_ta){:target="_blank"} (CME 100 and CME 104).

Professionally, I worked as the first Instructional Designer at [Citrine Informatics](https://citrine.io){:target="_blank"} prior to starting my PhD. My manager was [Josh Tappan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtappan/){:target="_blank"}. I was in charge of designing educational content around machine learning, materials science, and Citrine's software platform for a wide variety of audiences, including data scientists, materials engineers, and business managers. In addition to developing a pedagogical framework for informatics education, I created many [**open-source** Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/learn-citrination) as instructional tools, and led a day-long workshop at the [Texas A&M Summer School on Computational Materials Science](https://cms3.tamu.edu/). Some of this material has been adapted for a similar [Programmatic Materials Informatics](https://citrineinformatics.github.io/ga-tech-workshop/index.html){:target="_blank"} workshop at Georgia Tech. I hope to continue exploring the field of education during my PhD and continue developing my pedagogical skills.


### Social dance
I started social ballroom dancing two years ago and have fallen in love with it ever since. I learned the basic techniques of various waltzes (rotary, cross-step, Viennese, redowa), swing dances (4-count, 6-count, Lindy, west coast), Latin dances (tango, cha-cha, salsa), and miscellaneous (Night-club two step, hustle, polka, Schottische, Shim Sham, Tokyo Polka) from [Richard Powers](http://richardpowers.com/PowersCV.htm){:target="_blank"} in his social dance classes at Stanford. For the 2018-2019 school year, I was also a member of the [Viennese Ball Opening Committee](http://vienneseball.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I performed a choreographed [waltz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46LzArwG1w0){:target="_blank"} and [polka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhHvV_-1JbQ){:target="_blank"}. 

I am still dancing regularly and learning a ton—currently trying out [fusion dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_dance){:target="_blank"}. My favorite dances styles are probably [cross-step waltz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-step_waltz){:target="_blank"} and [west coast swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Swing){:target="_blank"}, but I am more than happy to lead/follow anything you're comfortable with. Hope to see you on the dance floor soon!


### Cooking
I love to cook! Most of my experience is with Chinese food---or at least made in that style---as that's what's made at home, but I do experiment with other cuisine from time to time. I'm currently forcing myself to learn how to bake and how to use an InstantPot, but these black-box, batch process methods are tough for someone who normally doesn't follow recipes (*dal cuore*, as my Italian teacher once said). Maybe I'll get a few photos uploaded soon.


### Aquatic sports
I love being in the water, and have swam at various levels of competition for a little over a decade now. My high school coach also introduced me to water polo, and I've competed with [St. Louis Area Polo](http://www.leagueathletics.com/?org=stlouisareapolo){:target="_blank"} (SLAP) in high school and Stanford Club Water Polo in college. Nowadays, I mostly swim to stay fit and relax the mind, so if you would like some motivation to jump in a pool at 7:00AM, please let me know (because I need some too)!


### Books, movies, and musicals
Finally, if I'm not doing one of the above activities, you will probably find me enjoying these forms of entertainment. I don't think my tastes for each medium are in and of themselves peculiar, but their combination might be. Always happy to take and prioritize any suggestions!

* **Books**: I love to read the genres of non-fiction, memoirs, and world literature (both fiction and non-fiction). 
    * See my [Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17216426-enze){:target="_blank"} for a list of books I've read.
* **Movies**: I love to watch rom-coms (shameless), animated films (particularly anime, but also Disney/Dreamworks/etc), and documentaries. I've also only recently discovered indie films and want to view more in this genre. 
    * See my [IMDb account](http://www.imdb.com/list/ls093778722/){:target="_blank"} for a list of movies I've watched.
* **Musicals**: I love musicals and showtunes! I've seen live and movie adaptations for about 30 musicals so far, but who's counting?
    * Favorites: Hamilton, Wicked, The Book of Mormon, Thoroughly Modern Millie.

## Education
After high school in the Midwest (St. Louis, MO), I have been fortunate enough to call the Bay Area home for the past five years and counting. Of course, you can imagine that [Big Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Game_(American_football)){:target="_blank"} is a tough test of loyalties.
