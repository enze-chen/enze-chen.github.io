Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in the Materials Science and Engineering ([MSE](https://www.mse.berkeley.edu/)) department at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). I am advised by [Mark Asta](https://www.mse.berkeley.edu/ourfaculty/astam) and my research is broadly in the domain of **computational structural materials**, leveraging the power of atomistic simulations and machine learning to inform alloy design.

Here is my <a href="enze-chen.github.io/files/resume_enze.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> for a one-page summary.

## Research projects

### UC Berkeley
This is just kicking off! Check back for more information.

### Sandia National Laboratories
During the summer of 2018, I was a R&D Intern at [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/) in Albuquerque, NM. I worked in the [Center for Computing Research](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/index.cfm) in the Multiscale Science Department (Org. 1444). My mentors were [John Mitchell](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/templates/insert/profile.cfm?jamitch) and [Jay Lofstead](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/templates/insert/profile.cfm?gflofst)

### Citrine Informatics
During the summer of 2017, I was a Data Science and Engineering intern at [Citrine Informatics](https://citrine.io) in Redwood City, CA. My mentors were Erin Antono, Jo Hill, and Bryce Meredig. Data engineering, customer project, and internal research on structural features for machine learning.

### Stanford University
Starting in the summer of 2016, I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the [Materials Theory and Computation Group](https://reedgroup.stanford.edu/index.html) at Stanford University. My mentors were [Qian Yang](http://www.qianyanglab.com/) and [Evan Reed](https://reedgroup.stanford.edu/staff/evanreed.html). Atomistic simulation and machine learning for chemical kinetics under extreme conditions.

### Washington University in St. Louis
My first exposure to the world of materials science came as a high school summer intern in the [Soft Nanomaterials Laboratory](https://softnano.wustl.edu/) at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). My mentors were [Limei Tian](https://engineering.tamu.edu/biomedical/profiles/tian-limei.html) and [Srikanth Singamaneni](https://engineering.wustl.edu/Profiles/Pages/Srikanth-Singamaneni.aspx).

## Other interests

### Education
In addition to MSE research, another passion of mine is education, including STEM curriculum design, learning theory, and programming skills instruction.

### Social dance
I started social dancing two years ago and have fallen in love with it ever since.

### Cooking
I love to cook! Most experience comes from Chinese food. Learning how to bake, but tough for someone who doesn't like to follow recipes (dal cuore).

### Aquatic sports
Ladue High School and [St. Louis Area Polo](http://www.leagueathletics.com/?org=stlouisareapolo) (SLAP). Stanford Club Water Polo.

### Books, movies, and musicals
Finally, if I'm not doing one of the above activities, you will probably find me enjoying these forms of entertainment. I don't think my tastes for each medium are in and of themselves peculiar, but their combination might be. Always happy to take and prioritize any suggestions!

* **Books**: I love to read the genres of non-fiction, memoirs, and world literature (both fiction and non-fiction).
    * 5 most recent titles: [Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3367956-hotel-on-the-corner-of-bitter-and-sweet), [Tuesdays with Morrie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6900.Tuesdays_with_Morrie), [Educated](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133922-educated), [10% Happier](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18505796-10-happier), [Becoming](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38746485-becoming).
* **Movies**: I love to watch rom-coms (shameless), animated films (particularly anime, but also Disney/Dreamworks), and documentaries. I've also only recently discovered indie films and want to view more in this genre.
    * 5 most recent titles: [One Child Nation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8923482/), [The Big Easy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092654/), [Moonstruck](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093565), [Dangal](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5074352/), [The Farewell](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8637428/).
* **Musicals**: I love musicals and showtunes! I've seen live and movie adaptations for about 30 so far, but who's counting?
    * 5 most recent titles: [My Fair Lady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Fair_Lady_(film)), [Meet Me in St. Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_Me_in_St._Louis), [A Little Night Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Little_Night_Music), [La Cage aux Folles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Cage_aux_Folles_(musical)), [Next to Normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_to_Normal).
