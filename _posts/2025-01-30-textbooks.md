title: Recommended MSE textbooks
permalink: /textbooks

I believe that the debate over the "best" textbooks has been waged for as long as textbooks have existed.
Not knowing any better, I will boldly offer my opinions here.
Obviously, I have not read every single textbook out there (even some of my recommendations, ha!) and my suggestions balance quality, popularity, and availability (books are expensive and [paywalls suck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_library){:target="_blank"}).
You should see if your school library has physical copies or electronic versions, as a few of these have digital versions.
Also, not everyone learns best by reading textbooks, but in case you'd like a fallback reference, here are my thoughts.

### General MSE

‚≠ê **Materials Science and Engineering: An Introduction** by William D. Callister and David G. Rethwisch.
This is the most widely used textbook in an introductory MSE course, and most people just refer to it as "Callister."
It's comprehensive, well-written, _well-illustrated_, widely available, and so popular that you might as well choose it over others.
No book is perfect, but I would be foolish to not recommend this first.

If you want to consider others:
- _Introduction to Materials Science for Engineers_ by James F. Shackelford.
Similar to Callister in organization and content.
- _Foundations of Materials Science and Engineering_ by William Smith and Javad Hashemi.
- _Introduction to Materials Science and Engineering: A Design-led Approach_ by Michael F. Ashby et al.
This is relatively new and could be interesting, as Ashby always takes a design-first approach to teaching.
- _Impact of Materials on Society_ by Sophia K. Acord et al.
An interesting text that mixes MSE with classics.


### Undergraduate and graduate

This section is harder to organize and the distinction between an undergrad vs. grad text is often blurred, so for simplicity it's a table where I list **preferred** and _less preferred_ titles and the rows generally range from core to elective topics.
Some of my favorites, particularly in terms of writing style and readability, are notated with ‚≠ê.

### General nonfiction

There's even some materials science books out there written for a general audience!
Here are the ones that come to mind.

- _Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World_ by Mark Miodownik.
- _The New Science of Strong Materials: Or Why You Don't Fall through the Floor_ by James E. Gordon.
- _Material World: A Substantial Story of Our Past and Future_ by Ed Conway.
- _The War Below: Lithium, Copper, and the Global Battle to Power Our Lives_ by Ernest Scheyder.
- _Made to Measure: New Materials for the 21st Century_ by Philip Ball.


### Prerequisites?

It occurred to me while writing this that maybe students are interested in textbooks that can help them brush up on more of the fundamental math and science.
I don't know this as well because there's a huge market for these textbooks, new versions are always being produced, and honestly, the concepts are so widely explained that your best bet may actually be YouTube, Khan Academy, etc.
Still, I'll try to offer some quick thoughts in a table, but I'm open to your suggestions!

| Subject | My recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| Calculus | - I've personally never had a good textbook, though I've heard Larson and Stewart are classics. <br> - If you've never heard of "Paul's Online Notes" I think they're worth checking out. Clear and succinct. <br> - But honestly I would Khan Academy this (practice problems!) or use 3Blue1Brown (visual explanations!). |
| Linear<br>algebra | - Ditto with calculus, and no shortage of videos and practice, with the rise of ML and whatnot. |
| Physics | - I think in high school I used either Halliday and Resnick or the Knight textbooks. <br> - Of course, a classic is _The Feynman Lectures on Physics_ by Richard Feynman himself, freely available through Caltech. |
| Chemistry | - I've heard that Brown and Atkins are pretty good, though this is in a similar boat as physics. <br> - I would probably use Khan Academy or YouTube. |
| Biology? | - The classic textbook for general biology is definitely _Campbell Biology_. <br> - Otherwise you're on your own. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è |
