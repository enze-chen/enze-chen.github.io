title: Recommended MSE textbooks
permalink: /textbooks

I believe it is fair to say that the debate over the "best" textbooks has been waged for as long as textbooks have existed.
Not knowing any better, I will boldly offer my opinions here.
Obviously, I have not read every single textbook out there (even some of my recommendations, ha!) and my suggestions balance quality, popularity, and availability (books are expensive and [paywalls suck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_library){:target="_blank"}).
Also, not everyone learns best by reading textbooks, but in case you'd like a fallback reference, here are my thoughts.


### General MSE

⭐ **Materials Science and Engineering: An Introduction** by William D. Callister and David G. Rethwisch.
This is the most widely used textbook in an introductory MSE course, and mostly people just refer to it as "the Callister text."
It's comprehensive, well-written, _well-illustrated_, widely available, and generally so popular that you might as well choose it over others.
No book is perfect, but I would be foolish to not recommend this first.

If you want to consider others:
- _Introduction to Materials Science for Engineers_ by James F. Shackelford.
Similar to Callister in organization and content.
- _Foundations of Materials Science and Engineering_ by William Smith and Javad Hashemi.
- _Introduction to Materials Science and Engineering: A Design-led Approach_ by Michael F. Ashby et al.
This is relatively new and could be interesting, as Ashby always takes a design-first approach to teaching.



### Undergraduate and graduate

This section is harder to organize and the distinction between an undergrad vs. grad text is often blurred, so for simplicity it's a table where I list **preferred** and _less preferred_ titles and the rows generally range from core to elective topics.
Some of my favorites, particularly in terms of writing style and readability, are notated with ⭐.

### General nonfiction

There's even some materials science books out there written for a general audience!
Here are the ones that come to mind.

- _Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World_ by Mark Miodownik.
- _The New Science of Strong Materials: Or Why You Don't Fall through the Floor_ by James E. Gordon.
