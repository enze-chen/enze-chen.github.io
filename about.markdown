#### Work experience 💼

| Title | Institution/Company | Years |

#### Name 📛

I go by "Enze" (typically pronounced "EN-zee," but I'll also respond to "ēnzé" if you know Chinese), so please feel free to address me as such in person and in email.
It's little cringe to hear "Dr. Chen," but I'll live; just no "Dr. Enze."

#### Education 🤓

Prior to teaching at Stanford, I graduated in 2023 with my PhD in [Materials Science and Engineering](https://www.mse.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} from the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
I was co-advised by [Prof. Mark Asta](https://mse.berkeley.edu/people_new/asta/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Timofey Frolov](https://people.llnl.gov/frolov2){:target="_blank"}, and my work was broadly in the domains of <span style="font-weight:500">computational structural materials and MSE education</span>.
Specifically, I built tools to study:
- [Antiphase boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-phase_domain){:target="_blank"} energies in Ni<sub>3</sub>Al-based alloys, the precipitate phase in nickel-based [superalloys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superalloy){:target="_blank"}. 
[[paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-022-00755-1){:target="_blank"}] 
- [Grain boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_boundary){:target="_blank"} phases in elemental metals, focusing on hexagonal close-packed [titanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium){:target="_blank"} for lightweighting. 
[_paper soon!_]
- [Materials informatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_informatics){:target="_blank"} education to train the next generation of scientists and engineers.
[[paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.2c00640){:target="_blank"}] 

Phrased another way, I used computers to study metals, and I learned about how students learn about materials, perhaps with the help of computers. 💻

My PhD was primarily funded by the National Science Foundation [Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/){:target="_blank"} (NSF GRFP), which is a fantastic opportunity that I [highly encourage]({% post_url 2020-8-8-nsfgrfp %}) you to apply for.
You can find a list of my publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=MMkofM4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate){:target="_blank"} page. 🎓

And prior to that, I completed my BS ('18) in Stanford MSE and my co-terminal MS in the Stanford [Institute for Computational & Mathematical Engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 
I did research in the group of the late [Prof. Evan Reed](https://mse.stanford.edu/people/memory-professor-evan-j-reed){:target="_blank"} and was heavily involved in [Stanford Splash](https://www.stanfordesp.org/){:target="_blank"}. 🌊
