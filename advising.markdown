No matter how I design my courses, it doesn't change the fact that <span style="font-weight:500">the majority of your learning will take place outside of the classroom and often in conversation with others</span>.
I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of countless mentors who have dedicated their time to offer me advice and opportunities.
That's why I try to make myself as available as possible for students and my door will always be open for you.


### Scheduling a meeting

The best way to meet with me is to _put some time on my calendar_!
Except I have learned that most students have no idea what I mean when I say this, so [here's a tutorial](https://youtu.be/f_LOyRQm1pI){:target="_blank"} that illustrates what I mean.
If I don't receive an email from you beforehand about our meeting, please put in the event description a brief message explaining what you want to talk about.
See you soon!

Needless to say, if you don't have access to or can't find my calendar, just email me or drop by to meet.


### But like, what do I say?

Here are some examples of the things we can talk about; but even if I don't have answers to all of your questions, I can likely connect you with someone who does!

- Come say hello! üëãüèº

- <span style="font-weight:500">Can you explain [this concept] to me?</span> 
Certainly, and I'll try to do a better job than [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/){:target="_blank"}!
I will expect these types of questions from my students, but even if you're not, I can give it a shot and I'm confident we'll work out a satisfying explanation together.

- <span style="font-weight:500">Should I [major in MSE](https://mse.stanford.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-program/major){:target="_blank"}?</span> 
What does it even mean [to be a "materials scientist?"](https://occamstypewriter.org/nicolaspaldin/2021/05/05/an-open-letter-to-students-of-materials-science-and-engineering/){:target="_blank"}
Let me try to convince you the answers are **yes!** and _everything_. üòÅ

- <span style="font-weight:500">What courses should I take?</span> 
How do I make a [four-year plan](https://ughb.stanford.edu/plans-program-sheets/program-sheets/program-sheets/program-sheets/program-sheets/program-sheets-0){:target="_blank"}? 
It can be daunting to have the next four years "figured out," so I'm happy to chat about options.
Hint: things never work out the way we expect, evident by [my own four-year plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qei_jYMdwKD7kmKV5YCM_0nhyDBxzsR0fvyDb2cAU0s/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

- <span style="font-weight:500">Can I do research in MSE as an undergrad?</span> 
You're in luck! The MSE Department offers many [undergraduate research opportunities](https://mse.stanford.edu/UGresearch){:target="_blank"}, including the flagship [Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)](https://mse.stanford.edu/REU){:target="_blank"} and [Undergraduate Research Grants (URG)](https://mse.stanford.edu/URG){:target="_blank"} in Winter/Spring quarter.
Both are based on applications and we will try to match you to a research group with a good fit.
Both programs are great learning opportunities with a small stipend.

- <span style="font-weight:500">Can I do research with _you_?</span> 
Sure! 
I am always thinking about [potential projects](/teaching/#projects-) and I welcome eager students who want to collaborate and make a lasting impact.
Our department also has [excellent Faculty](https://mse.stanford.edu/people/faculty){:target="_blank"} who do impactful, interdisciplinary research that I'm happy to connect you with, especially if you're looking for a more formal research advisor for graduate studies.

- <span style="font-weight:500">After graduation, should I work, do a Masters, or do a PhD?</span> 
[Should I do all of them?]({% post_url 2020-10-15-bsmsphd %}) 
Like all the other topics here, this is a personal decision and I'm happy to be a sounding board as you weigh your priorities.

- <span style="font-weight:500">Relatedly, what can I do with a [X] degree in MSE?</span> 
Good question!
I am of the opinion (biased, obv) that MSE sets you up, both technically and professionally, for any career.
So let's chat about what interests you and how you wish to make an impact in the world. üí™üèº

- <span style="font-weight:500">Fellowships seem like a ton of work; is it worth applying for the [GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/){:target="_blank"}, [NDSEG](https://ndseg.org/){:target="_blank"}, [CSGF](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/){:target="_blank"}, etc.?</span>
<span style="font-weight:500">Absolutely</span>, [for so many reasons]({% post_url 2020-08-08-nsfgrfp %}).
Let's chat!

- <span style="font-weight:500">How do I talk to Faculty?</span> 
What if they haven't replied to my emails?
Haha, a perennial problem!
Happy to discuss further, as it kinda depends on what you're going for;
while I can't promise you'll get a response, perhaps we can figure out a way to still get you what you want.

- <span style="font-weight:500">Do you have tips for improving science communication?</span> 
Yes, great question!
If you are asking about writing help, I will encourage you to check out the [Hume Center for Writing and Speaking](https://hume.stanford.edu/tutoring){:target="_blank"} or the [Technical Communication Program](https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/technical-communication-program){:target="_blank"} in [Huang Engineering](https://campus-map.stanford.edu/?srch=04-080){:target="_blank"}.
If you're asking about visual illustrations and plots, then I encourage you to check out my [MATSCI 122](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=matsci122){:target="_blank"} course where we discuss visualization principles and get hands-on training with software tools.
You are also free to use my Stanford MSE-themed templates for [documents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sfr_XQ0LwapQDIzobPFpjHfRk1QCmZfFgwzvm0gsz9g/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}, [presentations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LDv9veirAnjh2ZcnNkAmh1vTdW_8CCUpeRo9ybCxs2s/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}, and [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/read/skrzcznwvrfd#0715a5){:target="_blank"} if you like them!

- <span style="font-weight:500">How did you end up in your current role?</span> 
_Ha_‚Äîthat's a question that took ten years, several degrees, a lot of soul searching, and a whole lotta luck to finally answer.
Happy to chat more about this!

- And, if by some odd chance: Can you teach me how to use atomistic simulations to study planar defects? üòÇ
Why happily... never thought anyone would ask...

Of course, our conversations can extend beyond these topics and I look forward to chatting with you!
