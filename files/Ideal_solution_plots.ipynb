    "# An interactive notebook to learn the thermodynamics of ideal solutions \n",
    "\n",
    "*Authors: Enze Chen (University of California, Berkeley)*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interactive notebook for playing around with the temperature and observing the effect on the resulting free energy curves of a binary ideal solution. Following that, there is a small section for readers to complete their own code to generate the phase diagram for the ideal solution. There are [similar demos](http://www.learncheme.com/simulations/thermodynamics/thermo-2/effect-of-temperature-on-partial-miscibility) available online, but I couldn't find one that was interactive in this way and written in Python. Thermodynamics is fairly math-heavy and a tough subject to master, but I believe having quality visualizations can have a large, positive impact on your learning. I hope you will find this notebook functional, readable, and educational.\n",

    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1\n",
    "In the first half of this notebook, everything is completed for you and you just have to run it. To execute each cell of the notebook and automatically advance to the next cell, press `Shift+Enter`. Or you can click `Run All` in the menu at the top. When done successfully, you'll see a widget slider pop up that you can adjust and observe the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2\n",
    "In the second half, there are places for you to complete the code in order to construct the resulting phase diagram. These are delineated with the dashed lines as follows, and you should **only change what's inside**. You don't have to edit the text or code anywhere else.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ---------------------- #\n",
    "# YOUR CODE HERE\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---------------------- #\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you edit the code in a cell, just press `Shift+Enter` to run it again. You have to execute **all** the code cells in this notebook from top to bottom (so don't skip around). A number `[#]` will appear to the left of the code cell once it's done executing. When done successfully, you'll be able to generate a lens-shaped phase diagram at the very end.\n",
