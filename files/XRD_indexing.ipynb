    "This Jupyter notebook is meant expose MSE students with little to no Python experience to a programmatic way of indexing a XRD spectra. It walks through the process step-by-step, so I apologize if it appears quite long. I tried to include ample explanations for the scientific computing techniques and how they relate to math and MSE concepts they might otherwise be more familiar with.\n",

    "For pedagogical reasons, there are a few places for the students to fill in their own code in order to make the notebook fully functional. These are delineated with the dotted lines as follows, and you should **only change what's inside**. You don't have to edit the text or code anywhere else.\n",

    "To execute each cell of the notebook and automatically advance to the next cell, press `Shift+Enter`. If you edit the code in a cell, just press `Shift+Enter` to run it again. You have to execute **all** the code cells in this notebook from top to bottom (so don't skip around). A number `[#]` will appear to the left of the code cell once it's done executing."

    "## But why should I learn this?\n",
    "Good question! These were my motivations in creating this notebook:   \n",
    "* Computational tools are becoming **increasingly pervasive** in all sub-fields of MSE.\n",
    "    * In characterization, experimental data from high-energy physics and 4D-STEM are being generated at the rate of hundreds of GBs per second. The **bottleneck to scientific discovery** is now in processing and analyzing this data.\n",
    "* Both academia and industry are beginning to view programming as a **core competency**, even if you are \"not a programmer.\"\n",
    "* Indexing powder XRD patterns is a **routine procedure with several repetitive tasks**, making it a great candidate for programmatic solutions. Write once, run anytime.\n",
    "    * This also makes powder XRD a **great teaching example** for computationalists as well as experimentalists.\n",
    "* All the buzz around computer science can make these topics appear overwhelming and exclusive. Hopefully this notebook **lowers that barrier** by a teeny amount.\n",
    "* The choice of Python (over MATLAB, for example) is because it's **open source**, beginner-friendly, easily integrated with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), and **[insanely popular](https://149351115.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/growth_major_languages-1-1400x1200.png)**.\n",
    "    * If this notebook gets you excited, there are plenty of great resources and courses out there for learning Python. \n",
