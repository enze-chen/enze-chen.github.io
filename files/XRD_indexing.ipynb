    "This Jupyter notebook is meant expose MSE students with little to no Python experience to a programmatic way of indexing a XRD spectra. It walks through the process step-by-step, so I apologize if it appears quite long. I tried to include ample explanations for the scientific computing techniques and how they relate to math and MSE concepts they might otherwise be more familiar with.\n",

    "## Usage\n",
    "For pedagogical reasons, there are a few places for the students to fill in their own code in order to make the notebook fully functional. These are delineated with the dotted lines as follows, and you should only have to change what's inside.\n",
    "```python\n",

    "\n",
    "# ---------------------- #\n",
    "```\n",
    "To execute each cell of the notebook and automatically advance to the next cell, press `Shift+Enter`. You have to execute **all** the code cells in this notebook from top to bottom (so don't skip around). A number `[#]` will appear to the left of the code cell once it's done executing.\n",
