### Social dance üï∫üèª

I started social ballroom dancing two years ago and have fallen in love with it ever since. I learned the basic techniques of various waltzes (rotary, cross-step, Viennese, redowa), swing dances (4-count, 6-count, Lindy, west coast), Latin dances (tango, cha-cha, salsa), and miscellaneous (Night-club two step, hustle, polka, Schottische, Shim Sham, Tokyo Polka) from [Richard Powers](http://richardpowers.com/PowersCV.htm){:target="_blank"} in his social dance classes at Stanford. 
For the 2018-2019 school year, I was also a member of the [Viennese Ball Opening Committee](http://vienneseball.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I performed a choreographed [waltz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46LzArwG1w0){:target="_blank"} and [polka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhHvV_-1JbQ){:target="_blank"}. 

My favorite dance styles are probably [cross-step waltz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-step_waltz){:target="_blank"} and [west coast swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Swing){:target="_blank"}, but I am more than happy to lead/follow anything you're comfortable with. 
I admittedly have danced a lot less since the start of the pandemic, even as events slowly came back, but I am trying to get back at it as the East Bay dance community is really welcoming. 
Hope to see you on the dance floor soon!

### Cooking üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥

I love to cook! Most of my experience is with Chinese food---or at least made in that style---as that's what's made at home, but I do experiment with other cuisine from time to time. 
I'm currently forcing myself to learn how to bake and how to use an InstantPot, but these black-box, batch process methods are tough for someone like me who normally doesn't follow recipes (*dal cuore*, as my Italian teacher once said).

### Aquatic sports üèäüèª

I love being in the water, and have swam at various levels of competition for a little over a decade now. 
My high school coach also introduced me to water polo, and I've competed with [St. Louis Area Polo](http://www.leagueathletics.com/?org=stlouisareapolo){:target="_blank"} (SLAP) in high school and [Stanford Club Water Polo](https://rec.stanford.edu/club-sports){:target="_blank"} in college. 
Nowadays, I mostly swim to stay fit and relax the mind, which has been a blessing during the pandemic.
In August 2022 I also completed my first [Alcatraz swim](https://raceroster.com/events/2022/49869/2022-alcatraz-sharkfest-swim){:target="_blank"}! (photo on the homepage)

### Books, movies, and musicals üéûÔ∏è

Finally, if I'm not doing one of the above activities, you will probably find me enjoying these forms of entertainment. Always happy to take and prioritize any suggestions!

* **Books**: I love to read non-fiction, memoirs, and world literature (both fiction and non-fiction). 
    * See my [Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17216426-enze){:target="_blank"} for a list of books I've read.
* **Movies**: I love to watch rom-coms (shameless!), animated films (particularly anime, but also Disney/Dreamworks/etc), and documentaries. I've also only recently discovered indie films and want to view more in this genre. 
    * See my [Letterboxd account](https://letterboxd.com/Chengine/films/){:target="_blank"} for a list of movies I've watched.
* **Musicals**: I love musicals and showtunes! I've seen live and movie adaptations for about 30 musicals so far, but who's counting?
    * Favorites: [Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)){:target="_blank"}, [Wicked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)){:target="_blank"}, [The Book of Mormon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Mormon_(musical)){:target="_blank"}, [Guys and Dolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guys_and_Dolls){:target="_blank"}, [Thoroughly Modern Millie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughly_Modern_Millie_(musical)){:target="_blank"}.
