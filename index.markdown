Hello! ðŸ‘‹  

I am a second-year PhD student in the [Materials Science and Engineering](https://www.mse.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} (MSE) department at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 
I am advised by Prof. [Mark Asta](https://mse.berkeley.edu/people_new/asta/){:target="_blank"} and my research is broadly in the domain of **computational structural materials**. 
Put another way, I use computers to study metals. ðŸ’»

I am extremely grateful to receive funding from the following sources:     
* UC Berkeley MSE department (2019-2020)  
* [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov/){:target="_blank"} (Summer 2020)  
* [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/){:target="_blank"} (NSF) [Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/){:target="_blank"} (2020-2023).  

[//]: # (* UC Berkeley [College of Engineering](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} (2021-2022 as a [Graduate Student Instructor](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}).)     
[//]: # (* [DOE EFRC](https://science.osti.gov/bes/efrc){:target="_blank"}: [Fundamental Understanding of Transport Under Reactor Extremes](https://www.lanl.gov/projects/future/){:target="_blank"} (FUTURE) (2021-2022))

Here is my [resume](assets/files/resume_general.pdf){:target="_blank"} for a one-page summary.
