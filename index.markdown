Hullo! 👋🏼

I am a Lecturer in the [Materials Science and Engineering](https://mse.stanford.edu){:target="_blank"} (MSE) Department at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
I teach a variety of undergraduate MSE courses spanning structure, characterization, energy, and computing.
In my classrooms, you can expect to see a mix of lectures (with board work!), active learning, digital tools, and professional skills development (e.g., science communication).
I am grateful to work with the other Faculty and Staff to support our wonderful students!


#### Contact 📧

I'm always happy to chat with you, even if you're not from Stanford or Berkeley. 
See the [Teaching](teaching) page for some examples of what we can discuss.

<span style="font-weight:500">The best way to reach me is by email, at enze [at] stanford.edu</span>, and I will normally respond within 24 hours.
If you're feeling lucky, you can stop by my office in [Durand](https://campus-map.stanford.edu/?srch=04-540){:target="_blank"} 113 on Mon-Thu (I work from home on Fri).


#### Courses 📚

In Winter 2024, I am teaching [MATSCI 143](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=matsci143){:target="_blank"}, an undergraduate core course on materials structure and characterization.
All of the course information is located on [Canvas](https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/183661){:target="_blank"}.

In Spring 2024, I will likely be teaching [MATSCI 156](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=matsci156){:target="_blank"}, an undergraduate elective course on energy materials.
I am actively redesigning this course to build on [Prof. Bruce Clemens](https://mse.stanford.edu/professor-bruce-m-clemens){:target="_blank"}' legacy and equip our students with modern tools to create sustainable materials solutions.
