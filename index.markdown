Hullo! üëãüèº

I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate in the [Materials Science and Engineering](https://www.mse.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} (MSE) Department at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} (UCB).
I am co-advised by [Prof. Mark Asta](https://mse.berkeley.edu/people_new/asta/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Timofey Frolov](https://people.llnl.gov/frolov2){:target="_blank"}, and my research is broadly in the domain of _computational structural materials_.
Put another way, I use computers to study metals. üíª

I am extremely grateful to receive funding from the following sources:     
* UCB MSE department and [College of Engineering](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} (CoE) (2019-2020)  
* [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov/){:target="_blank"} (LLNL) (Summer 2020 and 2022)  
* [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/){:target="_blank"} (NSF) [Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/){:target="_blank"} (GRFP) (2020-2024).  
* UCB MSE department and CoE as a [Graduate Student Instructor](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} (GSI) (2021-2022).

Here is my [resume](assets/files/resume_general.pdf){:target="_blank"} for a one-page summary.
If you are looking for my teaching experiences, here's a [slightly different resume](assets/files/resume_teaching.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
