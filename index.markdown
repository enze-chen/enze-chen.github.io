Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I am a second-year PhD student in the [Materials Science and Engineering](https://www.mse.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} (MSE) department at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 
I am advised by Prof. [Mark Asta](https://mse.berkeley.edu/people_new/asta/){:target="_blank"} and my research is broadly in the domain of **computational structural materials**. 
Put another way, I use computers to study metals. ðŸ’»

I am extremely grateful to receive funding from the following sources:   
* UC Berkeley MSE department (2019-2020)
* [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/){:target="_blank"} (NSF) [Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/){:target="_blank"} (2020-2023).

Here is my [resume](assets/files/resume_general.pdf){:target="_blank"} for a one-page summary. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/enze-chen){:target="_blank"}, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enzechen/){:target="_blank"}, and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/enze_chen1){:target="_blank"}.
