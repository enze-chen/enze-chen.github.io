Hullo! ðŸ‘‹  

I am a third-year PhD student in the [Materials Science and Engineering](https://www.mse.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} (MSE) department at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} (UCB). 
I am advised by Prof. [Mark Asta](https://mse.berkeley.edu/people_new/asta/){:target="_blank"} and my research is broadly in the domain of **computational structural materials**. 
Put another way, I use computers to study metals. ðŸ’»

I am extremely grateful to receive funding from the following sources:     
* UCB MSE department and [College of Engineering](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} (CoE) (2019-2020)  
* [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov/){:target="_blank"} (LLNL) (Summer 2020)  
* [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/){:target="_blank"} (NSF) [Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/){:target="_blank"} (GRFP) (2020-2024).  
* UCB MSE department and CoE as a [Graduate Student Instructor](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} (GSI) (2021-2022).

Here is my [resume](assets/files/resume_general.pdf){:target="_blank"} for a one-page summary.

### Recent news ðŸ“°

* [**periodically updated**] If you're an **undergraduate** who's looking for a research project, please check my "Teaching" page to see if there is a project that we can work together on.

* 2022/01: This spring I will be a GSI in Prof. [Andrew Minor](https://mse.berkeley.edu/people_new/minor/){:target="_blank"}'s [MSE 104: Materials characterization](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2022-spring-matsci-104-001-lec-001){:target="_blank"} class. 
I am excited to continue supporting students and getting more practice with characterization tools! 

* 2021/08: My abstract submission for a presentation on integrating computational modules into MSE curricula was accepted to the [2021 MRS Fall Meeting](https://www.mrs.org/meetings-events/fall-meetings-exhibits/2021-mrs-fall-meeting){:target="_blank"} [BI01 Symposium](https://www.mrs.org/meetings-events/fall-meetings-exhibits/2021-mrs-fall-meeting/call-for-papers/detail/2021_mrs_fall_meeting/bi01/Symposium_BI01){:target="_blank"}! 
See you in Boston!

* 2021/08: This fall I am a GSI in Prof. [Lane Martin](https://mse.berkeley.edu/people_new/martin/){:target="_blank"}'s [MSE 45/L: Properties of Materials Laboratory](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2021-fall-matsci-45-001-lec-001){:target="_blank"} class. 
I look forward to working with undergrads in person again!

* 2021/06: This summer I am designing and teaching a 3-week module on [Introduction to Materials Informatics](https://enze-chen.github.io/mi-book){:target="_blank"} to UCB undergraduates as part of a 9-week outreach program in the [Materials Sciences Division](https://www2.lbl.gov/msd/){:target="_blank"} at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/){:target="_blank"}.

* 2021/04: This spring I am a volunteer section leader for [Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}! 
I'm super excited to contribute a small part towards this large project on global CS education led by Stanford University.

* 2021/03: I present my work at the [2021 TMS Annual Meeting](https://www.tms.org/TMS2021){:target="_blank"} on high-throughput computing and machine learning for antiphase boundary energies in Ni-based superalloys.
Stay tuned for an upcoming manuscript!
