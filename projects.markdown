Although I am not a principal investigator (PI, aka Faculty), it doesn't mean we can't build things together.
Some of these are materials science-related, some are education, and some are a mix.
Broadly speaking:
- I care about your **personal development** and you should make sure our work supports this goal.
Many projects below can be tailored to your specific interests.
- Some of this might be new science, but **useful and impactful tools** are my priority.
If you enjoy building, join me to make an impact.

Below are some longer-term projects that I am thinking about, <span style="font-weight:500">open to undergraduate and graduate students.</span>
These projects involve more extended conversations, 1+ quarters of weekly effort, and depending on the project and timing, we may be able to arrange some [compensation](https://ctl.stanford.edu/find-teaching-grants){:target="_blank"} for your efforts.
If one of them sounds interesting to you, we can discuss it and see if it's something we can pursue together.
_If you have your own ideas, I am also interested to know how I can support you._

Note: Given various constraints, the projects below are primarily meant for Stanford affiliates.
But I am happy to chat generally about ideas with anyone!

### Broader areas

- <span style="font-weight:500">Curriculum development</span>. 
This can take a variety of forms, either developing a new course, revamping existing content, or creating separate learning modules.
I am particularly interested in ideas that enhance _accessibility_ and/or _scalability_.

- <span style="font-weight:500">Curriculum support</span>.
This is different from the previous section because some enhancements aren't course-specific, but rather the MSE program as a whole.
These could include additional workshops, resource development, alumni engagement, etc.

- <span style="font-weight:500">Recruitment and Community</span>.
These two things go hand in hand. 
You can't just invite someone to the dance‚Äîyou gotta dance with them too.
We are always looking for ways to make sure our program is accessible to all students, and improve the student experience within the MSE community (same cohort, between years, UG-GR connection, etc.)


I want to conclude this section by saying that <span style="font-weight:500">you can make an impact at any level</span>, whether you're a first-year undergraduate or fifth-year PhD student.
I have personally worked on multiple projects, many self-driven, throughout my time at Stanford and Berkeley.
Moreover, there are <span style="font-weight:500">many</span> other members of the Stanford MSE community, past and present, who have contributed to the success of the department.
We look to _you_ for the future. ü´µüèº
