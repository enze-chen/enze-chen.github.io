### Research projects üî¨

{% include slider.html selector="slider2" %}


#### UC Berkeley üêª

For my PhD, I work with [Mark Asta](https://mse.berkeley.edu/people_new/asta/){:target="_blank"} and [Tim Frolov](https://pls.llnl.gov/people/staff-bios/msd/frolov-t){:target="_blank"} in the domain of computational structural materials. 
Specifically, I am interested in using atomistic simulations (namely, [density functional theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory){:target="_blank"} (DFT) and [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics){:target="_blank"} (MD)) and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning){:target="_blank"} (ML) to understand the properties of structural alloys and interfaces to improve computational materials design. 


#### Thesis work ‚úçüèº

At the end of my third year (May 2022) I passed my Qualifying Exam! 
For the rest of my thesis, I will be continuing some of the work on the ONR project and investigating the properties of grain/twin boundaries in titanium.
I anticipate working closely with both of my advisors and I'm excited to explore not only structural applications, but energy ones as well, through another internship at LLNL in Summer 2022.


#### Twin boundary phases (i.e., complexions) in Ti

In my second year, as I was wrapping up my APB project, I also played a small part in helping Shahriar with his project on [twin boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_twinning){:target="_blank"} [phase transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_boundary#Complexion){:target="_blank"} in elemental titanium.
This was a cool collaboration with him and several others (through an Office of Naval Research (ONR) grant) where I got to use DFT, MD, and a [grand canonical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_canonical_ensemble){:target="_blank"} structure search based on the [evolutionary algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm){:target="_blank"} in the [USPEX](https://uspex-team.org/en){:target="_blank"} code.
We found a few interesting phases that have important consequences for mechanical properties and alloy design. 
Our manuscript is currently in review, but you can find [a preprint on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06194){:target="_blank"}!


#### Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) ‚ò¢Ô∏è

In summer 2020, I was a [Materials and Chemistry Institute (MaCI) intern](https://pls.llnl.gov/careers/internship-programs/maci){:target="_blank"} at [LLNL](https://www.llnl.gov/){:target="_blank"} in Livermore, CA. I worked (remotely) in the [Computational Materials Science Group](https://pls.llnl.gov/people/divisions/materials-science-division/computational-materials-science-group){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of [Timofey Frolov](https://pls.llnl.gov/people/staff-bios/msd/frolov-t){:target="_blank"}. 
The primary focus was a company-funded project on Ni-based [superalloys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superalloy){:target="_blank"}, which relied on the generous computational resources provided by [Livermore Computing](https://hpc.llnl.gov/){:target="_blank"}. 
My [SLAM presentation](https://youtu.be/0VJRdJ6JF3o){:target="_blank"} on the superalloys project was one of 12 selected for a special presentation to the [Livermore Lab Foundation](https://livermorelabfoundation.org/){:target="_blank"}.
This was communicated in [an oral presentation](http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/B3B8C068CB9E55E6852585A6005C372B?OpenDocument){:target="_blank"} at [TMS 2021](https://www.tms.org/TMS2021){:target="_blank"} and in a [first-author publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-022-00755-1){:target="_blank"} in [*npj Computational Materials*](https://www.nature.com/npjcompumats/){:target="_blank"}.

### Before the PhD 

#### Stanford University üå¥

Starting in summer 2016 and continuing until my graduation, I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the [Materials Theory and Computation Group](https://reedgroup.stanford.edu/index.html){:target="_blank"} at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My mentors were [Qian Yang](http://www.qianyanglab.com/){:target="_blank"} (now Asst. Prof. at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/){:target="_blank"}) and Prof. [Evan Reed](https://reedgroup.stanford.edu/staff/evanreed.html){:target="_blank"}. 
My research used MD, [kinetic Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_Monte_Carlo){:target="_blank"} (KMC), and ML to study the chemical kinetics of hydrocarbon decomposition under extreme conditions. 
Specifically, I demonstrated that a machine-learned KMC model trained on isobutane (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>) decomposition could be used to accurately predict the reactions and species in methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) decomposition in mere minutes without the need to run another MD simulation that would take weeks. 
This work on chemical extrapolation has been communicated at my oral presentation at [MRS Fall 2017 TC04.08.08](https://www.mrs.org/fall2017-symposium-sessions?Code=TC04){:target="_blank"}, in a [first-author publication](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpca.8b09947){:target="_blank"} in [*The Journal of Physical Chemistry A*](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/jpcafh){:target="_blank"}, and in a [co-authored book chapter](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-05600-1_9){:target="_blank"} in [*Computational Approaches for Chemistry Under Extreme Conditions*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-030-05600-1){:target="_blank"}.


#### Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) ü¶Ö

During the summer of 2018, I was a R&D Intern at [SNL](https://www.sandia.gov/){:target="_blank"} in Albuquerque, NM. I worked in the [Center for Computing Research](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/index.cfm){:target="_blank"} in the Multiscale Science Department (Org. 1444). 
My mentors were [John Mitchell](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/templates/insert/profile.cfm?jamitch){:target="_blank"} and [Jay Lofstead](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/templates/insert/profile.cfm?gflofst){:target="_blank"}, and I assisted in the development of [Stitch](https://spparks.sandia.gov/doc/Section_start.html#start_3){:target="_blank"}, a new I/O (Input/Output) system that drastically reduces the computational resource requirements of large-scale additive manufacturing simulations in [SPPARKS](https://spparks.sandia.gov/){:target="_blank"}. 
This work has been communicated in a [co-authored publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9139788){:target="_blank"} in the conference proceedings of the [*34th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS) 2020*](http://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2020/index.html){:target="_blank"}.


#### Citrine Informatics üçä

During the summer of 2017, I was a Data Science and Engineering intern at [Citrine Informatics](https://citrine.io){:target="_blank"}, a startup headquartered in Redwood City, CA that specializes in using ML to accelerate materials science R&D. 
My mentors were Erin Antono, Jo Hill, and [Bryce Meredig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bmeredig/){:target="_blank"}. I worked on three projects during this summer. 
The first was data engineering related and involved scraping and cleaning data to construct a dataset of polymer properties. 
The second was an internal data science research project on structural features for ML predictions of material properties. 
The third was in collaboration on a customer project that used ML to identify organic semiconducting materials with high mobility (presented at [MRS Spring 2019 GI01.07.02](https://www.mrs.org/spring2019/symposium-sessions/symposium-sessions-detail?code=GI01){:target="_blank"}).


#### Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL)

My first exposure to the world of materials science came as a part of the [STARS](http://www.umsl.edu/~sep/STARS/index.html){:target="_blank"} summer program in 2012 in the [Soft Nanomaterials Laboratory](https://softnano.wustl.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [WUSTL](https://wustl.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 
My mentors were [Limei Tian](https://engineering.tamu.edu/biomedical/profiles/tian-limei.html){:target="_blank"} (now Asst. Prof. at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/){:target="_blank"}) and Prof. [Srikanth Singamaneni](https://engineering.wustl.edu/Profiles/Pages/Srikanth-Singamaneni.aspx){:target="_blank"}. 
My research involved synthesizing gold nanorods and characterizing shifts in their [localized surface plasmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localized_surface_plasmon){:target="_blank"} resonance spectra based on their dimensions and changes in their local environment. 
This work has been communicated in a [second-author publication](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la3034534){:target="_blank"} in [*Langmuir*](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/langd5){:target="_blank"}.
