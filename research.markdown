### Research projects üî¨

#### UC Berkeley

For my PhD, I am interested in using atomistic simulations (namely, [density functional theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory){:target="_blank"} (DFT) and [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics){:target="_blank"} (MD)) and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning){:target="_blank"} (ML) to understand the mechanical behavior of structural alloys and interfaces to improve computational materials design. 


#### Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)

In summer 2020, I was a [Materials and Chemistry Institute (MaCI) intern](https://pls.llnl.gov/careers/internship-programs/maci){:target="_blank"} at [LLNL](https://www.llnl.gov/){:target="_blank"} in Livermore, CA. I worked (remotely) in the [Computational Materials Science Group](https://pls.llnl.gov/people/divisions/materials-science-division/computational-materials-science-group){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of [Timofey Frolov](https://pls.llnl.gov/people/staff-bios/msd/frolov-t){:target="_blank"}. The primary focus was a company-funded project on Ni-based [superalloys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superalloy){:target="_blank"} and I also spent some time working on a [recrystallization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recrystallization_(metallurgy)){:target="_blank"} project. Both of these projects relied on the generous computational resources provided by [Livermore Computing](https://hpc.llnl.gov/){:target="_blank"}.


#### Stanford University

Starting in summer 2016 and continuing until my graduation, I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the [Materials Theory and Computation Group](https://reedgroup.stanford.edu/index.html){:target="_blank"} at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My mentors were [Qian Yang](http://www.qianyanglab.com/){:target="_blank"} (now Asst. Prof. at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/){:target="_blank"}) and Prof. [Evan Reed](https://reedgroup.stanford.edu/staff/evanreed.html){:target="_blank"}. My research used MD, [kinetic Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_Monte_Carlo){:target="_blank"} (KMC), and ML to study the chemical kinetics of hydrocarbon decomposition under extreme conditions. Specifically, I demonstrated that a machine-learned KMC model trained on isobutane (C4H10) decomposition could be used to accurately predict the reactions and species in methane (CH4) decomposition in mere minutes without the need to run another MD simulation that would take weeks. This work on chemical extrapolation has been communicated at my oral presentation at [MRS Fall 2017 TC04.08.08](https://www.mrs.org/fall2017-symposium-sessions?Code=TC04){:target="_blank"}, in a [**first-author** publication](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpca.8b09947){:target="_blank"} in [*The Journal of Physical Chemistry A*](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/jpcafh){:target="_blank"}, and in a [co-authored book chapter](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-05600-1_9){:target="_blank"} in [*Computational Approaches for Chemistry Under Extreme Conditions*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-030-05600-1){:target="_blank"}.


#### Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)

During the summer of 2018, I was a R&D Intern at [SNL](https://www.sandia.gov/){:target="_blank"} in Albuquerque, NM. I worked in the [Center for Computing Research](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/index.cfm){:target="_blank"} in the Multiscale Science Department (Org. 1444). My mentors were [John Mitchell](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/templates/insert/profile.cfm?jamitch){:target="_blank"} and [Jay Lofstead](https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/templates/insert/profile.cfm?gflofst){:target="_blank"}, and I assisted in the development of Stitch, a new I/O (Input/Output) system that drastically reduces the computational resource requirements of large-scale additive manufacturing simulations in [SPPARKS](https://spparks.sandia.gov/){:target="_blank"}. This work has been communicated in the conference proceedings of the [*34th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS) 2020*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9139788){:target="_blank"}.


#### Citrine Informatics

During the summer of 2017, I was a Data Science and Engineering intern at [Citrine Informatics](https://citrine.io){:target="_blank"}, a startup headquartered in Redwood City, CA that specializes in using ML to accelerate materials science R&D. My mentors were Erin Antono, Jo Hill, and [Bryce Meredig](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bmeredig/){:target="_blank"}. I worked on three projects during this summer. The first was data engineering related and involved scraping and cleaning data to construct a dataset of polymer properties. The second was an internal data science research project on structural features for ML predictions of material properties. The third was in collaboration on a customer project that used ML to identify organic semiconducting materials with high mobility (presented at [MRS Spring 2019 GI01.07.02](https://www.mrs.org/spring2019/symposium-sessions/symposium-sessions-detail?code=GI01){:target="_blank"}).


#### Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL)

My first exposure to the world of materials science came as a part of the [STARS](http://www.umsl.edu/~sep/STARS/index.html){:target="_blank"} summer program in 2012 in the [Soft Nanomaterials Laboratory](https://softnano.wustl.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [WUSTL](https://wustl.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My mentors were [Limei Tian](https://engineering.tamu.edu/biomedical/profiles/tian-limei.html){:target="_blank"} (now Asst. Prof. at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/){:target="_blank"}) and Prof. [Srikanth Singamaneni](https://engineering.wustl.edu/Profiles/Pages/Srikanth-Singamaneni.aspx){:target="_blank"}. My research involved synthesizing gold nanorods and characterizing shifts in their [localized surface plasmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localized_surface_plasmon){:target="_blank"} resonance spectra based on their dimensions and changes in their local environment. This work has been communicated in a [second-author publication](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la3034534){:target="_blank"} in [*Langmuir*](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/langd5){:target="_blank"}.
