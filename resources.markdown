## Resources for MSE education

<span style="color:#8C1515;font-size:18px;text-align:center;display:flex;justify-content:center">🙏🏼 <em>Your contributions are <strong>highly encouraged</strong>! [See below.](#contributing-)</em> 🙇🏼‍♂️</span>


In my experience, MSE educators are <span style="font-weight:500">_amazing_</span> and will work tirelessly for their students.
However, I've also noticed that there's not a lot of open sharing of resources, leaving many instructors to reinvent the wheel and new students to lack review content.
This is a missed opportunity to expand our impact, as I hold the mindset that <span style="font-weight:500">open science (education) is better science (education)</span>.

Fortunately, the tide is turning, but the resources out there (and there are many!) are still not easy to find.
Therefore, I have tried to compile a list of MSE educational resources—very broadly defined—that are mostly freely available online (legally!) in some format.
All rights belong to their respective owners.
These materials are geared toward teaching and learning, with the aim of making MSE education _more equitable, accessible, and fun for all_.
These resources can <span style="font-weight:500">benefit students</span> who are interested in learning a new topic <span style="font-weight:500">and instructors</span> who are looking for inspiration from peers.

I hope we can make this page a centralized resource that supports our community! 💙


### Catalog

Please peruse the following Airtable, which can also be found [**here**](https://airtable.com/appGOSeBV95X7tQGX/shrZBmjJuSp005JBT){:target="_blank"} if the embedded version isn't working or large enough.
It is a living project and will be updated as I learn about new resources!

#### Usage notes

- The table is best viewed on desktop. 
Mobile is decent—you can see individual entries, but can't filter/search.
- You can <span style="font-weight:500">Search</span> by clicking the 🔍 in the top-right or Ctrl+F.
- You can <span style="font-weight:500">Filter</span> by specific values in a set of columns, e.g., find only `Video` formats or `Thermo` topics, by right-clicking on any column header. Avoid using 'Group.'
- Online content will vary in quality, so I erred on the side of providing more options.
I also indicate personal recs for students 🤓 and instructors 🎓.
- **Students**: Learning is complex and time consuming, and _if you're looking for a silver bullet, this isn't it_.
You will have to put in the work to learn the material included in the above resources.
But with steady practice, [you'll get there](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/252665-practice-is-funny-that-way-for-days-and-days-you){:target="_blank"}! 🙂
	- _Hint:_ It's a lot more fun to learn and discuss with a peer!

### Contributing 💚

#### Sharing your materials

Sharing your materials can seem daunting and embarrassing at first, but it does a lot more good than collecting dust in your (digital) file drawer! 
Even if you don't want it linked here, I encourage you to put your materials somewhere accessible.
For this catalog, as long as you're allowed to share it and there's a functional URL, then we can work with it.


#### Adding to this list

I welcome suggestions for content! 
This can be something you created or something you know about that's not currently listed.
No resource is too small or trivial.
Please feel free to reach out to me (email or Slack), or **fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/aiPLKDJpSG27XdPG9){:target="_blank"}** with the name, URL, and description.
Conversely, I also appreciate you letting me know if a listed resource has changed or is no longer available. 😞


#### Acknowledgments

This compilation is motivated by the `awesome-X` movement, such as what my friend [Kevin Greenman](https://catholic.tech/academics/faculty/kevin-greenman){:target="_blank"} created for [chemical engineering](https://github.com/kevingreenman/awesome-chemical-engineering-education){:target="_blank"} or the page for [materials informatics](https://github.com/tilde-lab/awesome-materials-informatics){:target="_blank"}.
