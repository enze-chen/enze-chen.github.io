## Resources for MSE education

_Last updated: January 30, 2025_

<span style="color:#8C1515;font-size:18px;text-align:center;display:flex;justify-content:center">🙏🏼 <em>Your contributions are <strong>highly encouraged</strong>! [See below.](#contributing-)</em> 🙇🏼‍♂️</span>


In my experience, materials science and engineering (MSE) educators are <span style="font-weight:500">_amazing_</span> and will work tirelessly for their students.
However, I've also noticed that there's not a lot of open sharing of resources, leading many instructors to reinvent the wheel and limiting the potential impact of our work.
Put simply: <span style="font-weight:500">Open science (education) is better science (education)</span>.

That's not to say there aren't any available resources (there are many, in fact!), but rather they might not be easy to find.
Therefore, I have tried to compile a list of MSE educational resources—very broadly defined—that are freely available online (legally) in some format. 
These materials are geared toward teaching and learning;
that is, they convey information about a topic in MSE or how to teach MSE, rather than scientific discoveries or research protocols.
I believe these resources can <span style="font-weight:500">benefit students</span> who are interested in learning a new topic <span style="font-weight:500">and instructors</span> who are looking for inspiration from peers.

I hope we can make this page a centralized resource that supports our community! 💙

### Catalog

Please use the following Airtable, which can also be found <span style="font-weight:500">[here](https://airtable.com/appGOSeBV95X7tQGX/shrZBmjJuSp005JBT){:target="_blank"}</span> if the embedded version isn't working or large enough.

#### Usage notes

- You can <span style="font-weight:500">search</span> by clicking the 🔍 in the top-right or Ctrl+F.
- You can <span style="font-weight:500">filter</span> by specific values in a set of columns, e.g., find only `Video` resources.
- You can <span style="font-weight:500">group</span> to cluster the resources by sets of attributes.
- Like all practicing materials scientists, I had to choose a length scale (granularity) to work with.
So be aware that you might have to do some searching within a resource to find precisely the knowledge you seek!
- Students: Learning is complex and time consuming, and _if you're looking for a silver bullet, this isn't it_.
You will have to put in the work to learn the material included in the above resources.
But with steady practice, [you'll get there](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/252665-practice-is-funny-that-way-for-days-and-days-you){:target="_blank"}! 🙂

### Contributing 💚

#### Sharing your materials

Sharing your materials can seem daunting and embarrassing at first, but it does a lot more good than collecting dust in your (digital) file drawer! 
Even if you don't want it linked here, I encourage you to put your materials somewhere accessible.
For this catalog, as long as you're allowed to share it and there's a functional URL, then we can work with it.


#### Adding to this list

I welcome suggestions for content! 
This can be something you created or something you know about that's not currently listed.
Please feel free to reach out to me (email or Slack), or <span style="font-weight:500">fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/aiPLKDJpSG27XdPG9){:target="_blank"}</span> with the name, URL, and description.
Conversely, I also appreciate you letting me know if a listed resource has changed or is no longer available. 😞
