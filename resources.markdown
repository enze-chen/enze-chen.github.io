## Resources for MSE education

<span style="color:#8C1515;font-size:18px;text-align:center;display:flex;justify-content:center">🙏🏼 <em>Your contributions are <strong>highly encouraged</strong>! [See below.](#contributing-)</em> 🙇🏼‍♂️</span>


In my experience, MSE educators are <span style="font-weight:500">_amazing_</span> and will work tirelessly for their students.
However, I believe if we shared resources more openly, we could reinvent the wheel less and help students even more.
Put simply: I believe <span style="font-weight:500">open science (education) is better science (education)</span>.

To test this pet theory, I am trying to compile below a list of _all_ MSE educational resources—broadly defined—that are mostly available online (legally!) in some format.
All rights belong to their respective owners.
These resources can <span style="font-weight:500">benefit students</span> who are interested in learning a new topic <span style="font-weight:500">and instructors</span> who are looking for inspiration from peers.
It is my goal to make MSE education _more equitable, accessible, and fun_.

I hope we can make this page a centralized resource that supports our community! 💙

### Catalog

Peruse the following Airtable, which can also be found [**here**](https://airtable.com/appGOSeBV95X7tQGX/shrZBmjJuSp005JBT){:target="_blank"} in larger format.
This is a <span style="font-weight:500">living project</span> and will be frequently updated!

#### Usage notes (README)

- <span style="font-weight:500;color:#E50808">Looking for a specific subtopic?</span>
Try **Filter** by right-clicking on the appropriate column header, e.g., find only `Intro` Levels, `Thermo` Topics, `Textbook` Formats, etc. 
_Don't use_ 'Group.'

- <span style="font-weight:500;color:#820000">Prefer a quick search?</span>
You can also **Search** by clicking the 🔍 in the top-right corner or <kbd>Ctrl+F</kbd>.
_Please be conservative_, e.g., use "comput" to cover different suffixes.

- I try to indicate a few personal recs for students 🤓 and instructors 🎓.

#### Additional notes

- The table is best viewed on desktop. 
Mobile is decent—you can see individual entries, but can't filter/search.

- I had to choose a _length scale_ (granularity), so you may have to do some further digging in a resource (e.g., MIT OCW, Khan Academy) to find precisely the knowledge you seek.

- **Students**: Learning is complex and time consuming, and _if you're looking for a silver bullet, this isn't it_.
You will have to put in the work to learn the material included in the above resources.
But with steady practice, [you'll get there](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/252665-practice-is-funny-that-way-for-days-and-days-you){:target="_blank"}! 🙂

### Contributing 💚

There are many ways you can contribute to this project (Email/Slack or **fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/aiPLKDJpSG27XdPG9){:target="_blank"}**):
- <span style="font-weight:500">Share</span> your own MSE-related materials! Please include the name, URL, and description.
	- It can seem daunting or embarrassing, but it does a lot more good than collecting dust in your (digital) file drawer! 
- <span style="font-weight:500">Suggest</span> missing MSE-related content! _No resource is too small or trivial_.
- <span style="font-weight:500">Correct</span> a listing if the resource has changed or is no longer available. 😞
