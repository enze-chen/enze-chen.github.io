## Resources for MSE education

_Last updated: January 30, 2025_

<span style="color:#8C1515;font-size:18px;text-align:center;display:flex;justify-content:center">🙏🏼 <em>Your contributions are <strong>highly encouraged</strong>! [See below.](#contributing-)</em> 🙇🏼‍♂️</span>


In my experience, materials science and engineering (MSE) educators are <span style="font-weight:500">_amazing_</span> and will work tirelessly for their students.
However, I've also noticed that there's not a lot of open sharing of resources, leading many instructors to reinvent the wheel.
This [unintentional] gatekeeping of knowledge is pretty unfortunate and limits the potential impact of our work going forward.
<span style="font-weight:500">Open science (education) is better science (education)</span>.

That's not to say there aren't any available resources (there are many, in fact!), but rather they might not be easy to find.
Therefore, I have tried to compile a list of MSE educational resources—very broadly defined—that are freely available online (legally) in some format. 
These materials are geared toward teaching and learning;
that is, they convey information about a topic in MSE or how to teach MSE, rather than scientific discoveries or research protocols.
I believe these resources can <span style="font-weight:500">benefit students</span> who are interested in learning a new topic <span style="font-weight:500">and instructors</span> who are looking for inspiration from peers.

I hope we can make this page a centralized resource that supports our community! 💙

### Catalog

The resouces may be found in the following Airtable, which can also be found <span style="font-weight:500">[here](https://airtable.com/appGOSeBV95X7tQGX/shrZBmjJuSp005JBT){:target="_blank"}</span> if the embedded version isn't working or large enough.

#### Suggested usage

- You can <span style="font-weight:500">search</span> by clicking the 🔍 in the top-right or Ctrl+F.
- You can <span style="font-weight:500">filter</span> by specific values in a set of columns, e.g., find only `Video` resources.
- You can <span style="font-weight:500">group</span> to cluster the resources by sets of attributes.

### Contributing 💚

#### Sharing your materials

Sharing your materials can seem daunting and embarrassing at first, but it does a lot more good than collecting dust in your (digital) file drawer! 
Even if you don't want it linked here, I encourage you to put your materials somewhere accessible.
Of course, first, <span style="font-weight:500">be certain</span> that:
1. You're _allowed_ to share your materials, legally and otherwise.
1. You have eliminated any personal identifiable information, particularly those about your students.

Otherwise, as long as there's a functional URL, then we can work with it and I am appreciative of your support!


#### Adding to this list

I welcome suggestions for content! 
This can be something you created or something you know about that's not currently listed.
Please feel free to reach out to me by email, Slack, LinkedIn, etc., and include the following information:

* Resource name
* Resource URL
* Short description of resource, including the original authors and their affiliation.
* Attributes for the format, usage, etc.
