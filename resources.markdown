## Resources for MSE education

_Last updated: August 1, 2024_

<span style="color:#8C1515;font-size:18px;text-align:center;display:flex;justify-content:center">üôèüèº <em>Your contributions are <strong>highly encouraged</strong>! [See below.](#contributing-)</em> üôáüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</span>


In my experience, materials science and engineering (MSE) educators are <span style="font-weight:500">_amazing_</span> and will work tirelessly for their students.
From talking to them and in my own work, I've also noticed that there's not a lot of open sharing of resources, leading many instructors to reinvent the wheel.
This gatekeeping of knowledge is pretty unfortunate and limits the potential impact of our work going forward.
<span style="font-weight:500">Open science (education) is better science (education)</span>.

That's not to say there aren't any available resources (there are many, in fact!) but rather it might not be easy to find 
Therefore, I have compiled here a list of MSE educational resources‚Äîvery broadly defined‚Äîthat are freely available online (legally) in some format. 
They encompass general resources, course curricula, and more, with an eye toward teaching and learning;
that is, the linked materials should convey information about a topic in MSE or how to teach MSE, rather than scientific discoveries or research protocols.
These resources can <span style="font-weight:500">benefit students</span> who are interested in learning a new topic <span style="font-weight:500">and instructors</span> who are looking for inspiration from peers.
I hope we can make this page a centralized resource that supports our community! üíô

### General resources

These are usually websites that have a range of resources, both technical and non-technical, about the field of MSE or learning activities.
Resources offering career advice and life skills can also go here.

- [Materials Science and Engineering Student](https://msestudent.com/) [R] - Many articles‚Äîmany of them technical with nice graphics and equations‚Äîabout all things MSE written by a few enthusiasts.
- [Dissemination of IT for the Promotion of Materials Science (DoITPoMS)](https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/index.php) [R/V/A] - A large library of resources from the University of Cambridge.
- [nanoHUB](https://nanohub.org/) [L/R/V/A/O] - A website with tons of resources for MSE education from Purdue University, with a focus on computational tools.
- [MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Materials%20Science%20and%20Engineering) [L/V/A] - Archived MSE classes from MIT.
- [MITx Online](https://dmse.mit.edu/mitx-online/) [L/R/V/A] - Current MSE classes from MIT.

#### Networking

Here are some digital platforms where you can connect with other MSE educators.

- [ASEE Materials Division](https://sites.asee.org/materials/) [O] - Centralized information about the Materials Division with ASEE.
They now have a [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/asee-materials-division/) as well.
- [nanoHUB Materials Science group](https://nanohub.org/groups/materials) [L/R/V/A/O] - Many resources for MSE Educators
- [University Materials Council](https://www.umatcon.org/) [O] - Formal organization for MSE departments across North America, but the website is fairly outdated.

---------------------------------


### Core curriculum

These are curricula that focus on an undergraduate core topic, loosely defined as Intro to MSE, Structure, Thermodynamics, Kinetics, Characterization, and Quantum.
Associated lab manuals, if they accompany the lecture course, can also go here.

- [Impact of Materials on Society](https://ufl.pb.unizin.org/imos/) [R/A]
- [Northwestern MSE Core Curriculum](https://msecore.northwestern.edu/) [R/A] - Course notes and practice problems for most of the undergraduate core taught at Northwestern University.
- [Quantum Mechanics course reader](https://github.com/enze-chen/mse_142_cr) [R] - Course notes for Aaron Lindenberg's undergraduate quantum mechanics course at Stanford University.

---------------------------------


### Elective curriculum

These are curricula that focus on essentially everything else: Properties, [_X_ Materials], Applications, Computing, and more!

- [foo](bar) [L/R] - Description.

---------------------------------


### Scholarship of teaching

This section is mostly for instructors and curious students who want to learn about education research and new pedagogies in MSE.

- [ASEE PEER Document Repository](https://peer.asee.org/) [R] - Archive of all publications at ASEE-affiliated conferences.
- [_Journal of Chemical Education_](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/jceda8) [R] - A popular venue for publishing chemistry and materials related education research, activities, commentary, etc.
- [_Journal of Engineering Education_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/21689830) [R] - An ASEE-affiliated publication for rigorous engineering education research.
- [_Journal of Materials Education_](https://icme.unt.edu/journal) [R] - Published by the International Council on Materials Education, though less popular than the previous venues.
- [_Frontiers in Education_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/1000297/all-proceedings) [R] - An IEEE-affiliated Conference with published manuscripts.


#### Conferences
Here is a non-exhaustive list of places where you can meet other MSE Educators:

- [North American Materials Education Symposium (NAMES)](https://www.materialseducation.com/) - Annual conference (2-day event) specifically for MSE education.
Talks and posters, but no proceedings.
- [ASEE Annual and Regional Conferences](https://www.asee.org/events/Conferences-and-Meetings) - Many publish to present options, for talks and posters.
- Elizabeth Judson Memorial Symposium at the TMS Annual Meeting ([2025 example](https://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/UpcomingSymposia/96EA4CC1205A0C7185258AB50002736A?OpenDocument&ParentUNID=268FE297891FF1D785258687004BB316)) - The only symposia at TMS dedicated to MSE education.
Generally talks with no posters or proceedings.
- [Frontiers in Education (FIE) Conference](https://fie-conference.org/) - Conference on general engineering topics with a publication option.
- Select symposia at MRS, ACS, etc. - Similar to the Judson, but few and far between.
Check calls periodically.

### Contributing üíö

#### Sharing your materials

Sharing your materials openly can seem daunting and embarrassing at first, but it does a lot more good than collecting dust in your (digital) file drawer! 
Even if you don't want it linked here, I encourage you to put your materials somewhere accessible.
Of course, first, <span style="font-weight:500">be certain</span> that:
1. You're _allowed_ to share your materials, legally and otherwise.
1. You have eliminated any personal identifiable information, particularly those about your students.

Once you have done so, I suggest you store your materials in a semi-permanent location: 
* Something like GitHub is a good choice or a personal website (if you can continue to host the domain).
* Google Drive is OK if it's a personal account; institutional accounts may delete data once you leave.

Ultimately, if there's a functional URL for now, then we can work with it and I am appreciative of your support!


#### Adding to this list

I welcome suggestions for content! 
This can be something you created or something you know about that's not currently listed.
Please feel free to reach out to me by email, text, LinkedIn, etc., and include the following information:

* Resource name
* Resource URL
* Resource type [L/R/V/A/O] - **L**ectures (slides), **R**eadings (any long-form text), **V**ideos (including animations, podcasts, and interactive media), **A**ssignments (of any kind, including labs), **O**ther. 
* Short description of resource, including the original authors and their affiliation.
