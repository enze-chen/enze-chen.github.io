## Resources for MSE education

<span style="color:#8C1515;text-align:center;display:flex;justify-content:center"> <em>Your contributions are **highly encouraged**! [See below.](#contributing-)</em> </span>


In my experience, MSE educators are <span style="font-weight:500">_amazing_</span> and will work tirelessly for their students.
And if we shared resources more openly, we could reinvent the wheel less and help students _even more_.
I truly believe <span style="font-weight:500">open science (education) is better science (education)</span>.

To test this pet theory, I am trying to compile below a list of _all_ MSE educational resources—broadly defined—that are mostly available online (legally!) in some format.
These resources can <span style="font-weight:500">benefit students</span> who are interested in learning a new topic <span style="font-weight:500">and instructors</span> who are looking for inspiration from peers.
It is my goal to make MSE education _more equitable, accessible, and fun_.

I hope we can make this page a centralized resource that supports our community! 💙

### Catalog and Instructions (README)

Peruse the following Airtable, which can also be found [**here**](https://airtable.com/appGOSeBV95X7tQGX/shrZBmjJuSp005JBT){:target="_blank"} in larger format.
This is a <span style="font-weight:500">living project</span> and will be frequently updated!
A video tutorial can be found [here](https://youtu.be/irgGLJOcoT8){:target="_blank"}.

- <span style="font-weight:500;color:#E50808">Browsing a subtopic?</span>
Try **Filter** by right-clicking on the appropriate column header, e.g., find only `Intro` Levels, `Thermo` Topics, `Textbook` Formats, etc. 
_Don't use_ 'Group' and _don't_ try to review everything.

- <span style="font-weight:500;color:#820000">Know specifically what you need?</span>
You can also **Search** by using <kbd>Ctrl+F</kbd>.
_Please be conservative_, e.g., use "comput" to cover different suffixes.

- I try to indicate a few personal recs for students 🤓 and instructors 🎓.
Filter by this column for a condensed list.

#### Additional notes

- The table is best viewed on desktop. 
Mobile is decent—you can see individual entries, but can't filter/search.

- The dense text/colors can be <span style="font-weight:500;color:#D1660F">overwhelming</span>, I know.
So I repeat: _Do not_ look at every resource or be frozen by stress—if nothing else, start with recs.

- I had to choose a _length scale_ (granularity), so you may have to do some further digging in a resource (e.g., MIT OCW, Khan Academy) to find precisely the knowledge you seek.

- All materials rights belong to their respective owners.
All opinions are my own.

- **Students**: Learning is complex and time consuming, and _if you're looking for a silver bullet, this isn't it_.
You will have to put in the work to learn the material included in the above resources.
But with steady practice, [you'll get there](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/252665-practice-is-funny-that-way-for-days-and-days-you){:target="_blank"}! 🙂
