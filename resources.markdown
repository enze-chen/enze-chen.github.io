## Resources for MSE education

<span style="color:#8C1515;font-size:18px;text-align:center;display:flex;justify-content:center">🙏🏼 <em>Your contributions are <strong>highly encouraged</strong>! [See below.](#contributing-)</em> 🙇🏼‍♂️</span>


In my experience, MSE educators are <span style="font-weight:500">_amazing_</span> and will work tirelessly for their students.
However, I've also noticed that there's not a lot of open sharing of resources, leaving many instructors to reinvent the wheel and new students to lack review content.
This is a missed opportunity to expand our impact, as I hold the mindset that <span style="font-weight:500">open science (education) is better science (education)</span>.

Fortunately, the tide is turning, but the resources out there (and there are many!) are still not easy to find.
Therefore, I am trying to compile a list of _all_ MSE educational resources—very broadly defined—that are mostly freely available online (legally!) in some format.
All rights belong to their respective owners.
These materials are for teaching/learning (not research, per se), with the aim of making MSE education _more equitable, accessible, and fun_.
These resources can <span style="font-weight:500">benefit students</span> who are interested in learning a new topic <span style="font-weight:500">and instructors</span> who are looking for inspiration from peers.

I hope we can make this page a centralized resource that supports our community! 💙


### Catalog

Please peruse the following Airtable, which can also be found [**here**](https://airtable.com/appGOSeBV95X7tQGX/shrZBmjJuSp005JBT){:target="_blank"} if the embedded version isn't working or large enough.
It is a living project and will be updated as I learn about more resources!

#### Usage notes

- The table is best viewed on desktop. 
Mobile is decent—you can see individual entries, but can't filter/search.
- **Did you know?** You can **Filter** by specific resources, e.g., find only `Textbook` formats or `Thermo` topics, by right-clicking on the column header. 
This is a common use case.
_Avoid using_ 'Group.'
- You can also <span style="font-weight:500">Search</span> by clicking the 🔍 in the top-right corner or Ctrl+F.
- Given the huge variation in resource quality, I try to indicate a few personal recs for students 🤓 and instructors 🎓.
- **Students**: Learning is complex and time consuming, and _if you're looking for a silver bullet, this isn't it_.
You will have to put in the work to learn the material included in the above resources.
But with steady practice, [you'll get there](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/252665-practice-is-funny-that-way-for-days-and-days-you){:target="_blank"}! 🙂

### Contributing 💚

There are many ways you can contribute to this project:
- <span style="font-weight:500">Share</span> your materials online!
It can seem daunting or embarrassing, but it does a lot more good than collecting dust in your (digital) file drawer! 
- <span style="font-weight:500">Suggest</span> missing content! 
Please feel free to reach out to me (email or Slack), or **fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/aiPLKDJpSG27XdPG9){:target="_blank"}** with the name, URL, and description.
	- This can be something you created or something you know about that's not currently listed. 
	_No resource is too small or trivial_.
- <span style="font-weight:500">Correct</span> a listing (use form) if the resource has changed or is no longer available. 😞
