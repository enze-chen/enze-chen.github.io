I absolutely <span style="font-weight:500">love teaching</span> and I am excited by the opportunity to help students succeed‚Äîacademically, professionally, and personally.
I also enjoy learning about research in STEM education, with a focus on curriculum design, informatics/AI education, and universal design for learning. üß†

### In the classroom üë®üèº‚Äçüè´

For all my classes, I like to use a somewhat comprehensive syllabus, such as [this example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrbCX5s_n8fGaEtbU1wuzEMItDOB4LknTW6fQCOxebY/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.
In the past, I have taught:
- [ENGR 50M](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=engr50m){:target="_blank"} - Introduction to materials science, biomaterials emphasis: 
[A25](https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/213191){:target="_blank"}
- [MATSCI 122](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=matsci122){:target="_blank"} - Visual communication in MSE: 
[W25](https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/202301){:target="_blank"}, 
[W26], 
[public](https://bit.ly/mse122public){:target="_blank"}
- [MATSCI 131](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=matsci131){:target="_blank"} - Materials scientists in training:
[S25](https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/207708){:target="_blank"}, 
[S26]
- [MATSCI 143](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=matsci143){:target="_blank"} - Structure and characterization: 
[W24](https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/183661){:target="_blank"}, 
[A24](https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/196708){:target="_blank"}, 
[A25](https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/213064){:target="_blank"}, 
[public](https://bit.ly/mse143public){:target="_blank"}
- [MATSCI 156](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=matsci156){:target="_blank"} - Materials for the energy solution: 
[S24](https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/190305){:target="_blank"}, 
[S25](https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/205722){:target="_blank"}, 
[S26], 
[public](https://bit.ly/mse156public){:target="_blank"}

 The indicated terms link to Canvas (for enrolled students) while the "public" link is for a public subset of those materials.


Also, there's a lot of discussion out there on effective and inclusive pedagogy, but less discussion about structure/logistics that make for a good teaching and learning experience.
This is interesting to me, because while the former is usually more involved and contentious (but impactful!), the latter is lower hanging fruit and _equally important_ in creating a smooth experience for instructors and students.
So I recorded [some thoughts here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15XXIS8MBmj-URnKJWPqF3X5mm47GiP-hIcJo6h6GbJU/edit?tab=t.0){:target="_blank"} (requires Stanford auth) about my workflow when setting up a new course.


#### Helpful software

Here are some great apps that were recently introduced to me:
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/){:target="_blank"} for lesson planning.
- [Padlet](https://padlet.com/){:target="_blank"} for in-class discussions and other brainstorming.
- [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/){:target="_blank"} for in-class games.
- [CATME](https://info.catme.org/){:target="_blank"} for structuring team-based assignments.
- [Stanford's AI Playground](https://aiplayground-prod.stanford.edu/c/new){:target="_blank"} for experimenting with generative AI models.
Requires Stanford authentication.

You are also free to use my Stanford MSE-themed templates for [documents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sfr_XQ0LwapQDIzobPFpjHfRk1QCmZfFgwzvm0gsz9g/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}, [presentations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LDv9veirAnjh2ZcnNkAmh1vTdW_8CCUpeRo9ybCxs2s/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}, and [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/read/skrzcznwvrfd#0715a5){:target="_blank"} if you like them!
Note these are _unofficial_, but I followed the [identity guide](https://identity.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}.


#### Teaching assistants 

If you're interested in TA-ing for one of my courses, you're welcome to reach out, but for the most part my TAs are pre-assigned in advance (and not by me üòî).
Exceptions can be made for particularly strong fits, of course, and it is true that at Stanford (and most places) instructors get to pre-select their TAs.
I always like to share [some guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15VQWynIaDy42vuYOna7G1mKrQoeFY5NavKbKEAuAG2Q/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} with my TAs so that we're on the same page and so I can best support them!


---------------------------------


### Other

This is more relevant for job applications than teaching, but you can see some of my philosophy in [my teaching statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EGvUmu5he7DbDgeKDURlCpgEXWDb8NEwWh9K8qIFSKs/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} that I submitted to Stanford.
My corresponding [teaching demo](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14g4NKJ20b5cIvt4U7KdkPCuzAP2_mdBXeJ-tLvxdR24/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} is representative of how I'd teach a lesson.
