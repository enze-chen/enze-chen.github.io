I absolutely **love** teaching and I am excited to make an impact in MSE education in the future. üë®üèª‚Äçüè´ I also enjoy learning about research in STEM education, with a focus on curriculum design and learning theory. üí°

### UC Berkeley

#### Mentoring

**Undergraduate students!** If you are interested in learning more about research, computational materials science, graduate life, Work vs. Masters vs. PhD (hint: all of the above), or something else, I am always happy to chat. I don't have a concrete research project for you, but if you are an independent thinker who wants to pick up some new skills, then maybe we can find something that best suits your interests. The research topics I'm personally most interested in are structural interfaces, materials informatics, and STEM education.

I am also a volunteer Peer Advisor with the [Graduate Pathways to STEM](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/admissions/graduate-admissions/graduate-student-outreach/graduate-pathways-to-stem/){:target="_blank"} (GPS) program that promotes graduate school opportunities to underrepresented minorities (URMs).

#### Teaching assistant and other

I hope to continue exploring the field of education during my PhD and to continue developing my pedagogical skills. I have already created several [computational MSE learning modules](https://github.com/enze-chen/learning_modules/){:target="_blank"} that use [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/){:target="_blank"} for interactive visualizations. I plan to introduce them in the 2020-2021 school year in a few MSE courses.

I am also a volunteer teacher for [Berkeley Splash](https://berkeley.learningu.org/){:target="_blank"} (high schoolers) and [Bay Area Scientists in Schools](http://www.crscience.org/volunteers/aboutbasis){:target="_blank"} (3rd graders).


#### MSE Graduate Student Council

I am also the Academic & Industry Liaison for the [MSE Graduate Student Council](http://msegsc.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}. In this role, I have helped with:

* Organizing community building events, such as *C^3: Coffee, Cookies, and Community* before our weekly Thursday seminars.
* Hosting our student-nominated seminar speakers (Spring 2020: [Ju Li](http://li.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} from MIT).
* Organizing industry info sessions (Spring 2020: [Exponent](https://www.exponent.com/){:target="_blank"}).
* Curating [preliminary exam materials](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1IpYgjRKMYpQVmu84i3yQ_TgTvwVKhiR6){:target="_blank"} for future cohorts (requires a Berkeley account to access).
* Creating several resources for remote instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic:  
    * A [Zoom guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ETVVHGrWccp7gC6zYV0F4nFS6qkMO8jKiS_h66Undlo/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} for instructors and students.
    * A [YouTube tutorial for active learning](https://youtu.be/kFp7f4Uz2fI){:target="_blank"} with Zoom breakout rooms.
    * A [YouTube tutorial for problem-solving sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT6T8_uEOEA){:target="_blank"} with Zoom breakout rooms.
    * I led a student focus group and we offered a list of recommendations for MSE faculty for online instruction.

### Professional experience

I worked as the first Instructional Designer at [Citrine Informatics](https://citrine.io){:target="_blank"} prior to starting my PhD. My manager was [Josh Tappan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtappan/){:target="_blank"}. I was in charge of designing educational content around machine learning, materials science, and Citrine's software platform for a wide variety of audiences, including data scientists, materials engineers, and business managers. In addition to developing a pedagogical framework for informatics education, I created many [open-source Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/learn-citrination) as instructional tools, and led a day-long workshop at the [Texas A&M Summer School on Computational Materials Science](https://cms3.tamu.edu/). Some of this material has been adapted for a similar [Programmatic Materials Informatics](https://citrineinformatics.github.io/ga-tech-workshop/index.html){:target="_blank"} workshop at Georgia Tech.

### Stanford University

#### Stanford Splash

During my undergrad, I was extremely involved with [Stanford Splash](https://www.stanfordesp.org/){:target="_blank"}, an educational outreach organization that brings nearly 2000 middle school and high school students to campus to take classes designed and taught by over 300 Stanford students. I also taught at 10 different programs and some of my course materials can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/enze-chen/splash_classes){:target="_blank"}.

#### Teaching assistant and other 

During my last two quarters, I worked as a TA in two undergraduate math classes, both of which were taught by [Vadim Khayms](https://profiles.stanford.edu/vadim-khayms){:target="_blank"}. Some of the course materials I created can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/enze-chen/stanford_ta){:target="_blank"}.
* Spring 2018: CME 104 - Linear Algebra and Partial Differential Equations for Engineers. ~30 students.
* Fall 2018: CME 100 - Vector Calculus for Engineers. ~160 students.

I also wrote a [new coursereader](https://github.com/enze-chen/mse_142_cr){:target="_blank"} for the core undergraduate quantum mechanics class ([MATSCI 142](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=matsci142&collapse=){:target="_blank"}) taught by [Aaron Lindenberg](https://mse.stanford.edu/people/aaron-lindenberg){:target="_blank"}.
