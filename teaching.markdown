I absolutely <span style="font-weight:500">love teaching</span> and I am excited by the opportunity to help students succeed—academically, professionally, and personally.
I also enjoy learning about research in STEM education, with a focus on curriculum design and learning sciences. 🧠


#### Advising 💡

No matter how I design my courses, it doesn't change the fact that <span style="font-weight:500">the majority of your learning will take place outside of the classroom and often in conversation with others</span>.
That's why I try to make myself as available as possible for students and my door will always be open for you.
Here are some examples of the things we can talk about; but even if I don't have the answer to all of your questions, I can connect you with someone who does or help expand your views of what's possible.
