I absolutely <span style="font-weight:500">love teaching</span> and I am excited by the opportunity to help students succeed‚Äîacademically, professionally, and personally.
I also enjoy learning about research in STEM education, with a focus on curriculum design, informatics/AI education, and universal design for learning. üß†

#### In the classroom üë®üèº‚Äçüè´

This is more relevant for job applications than teaching, but you can see some of my philosophy in [my teaching statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dS964ykkjEU5cCv09GC5wE4g_acH62aC61ai9U3zEB4/edit){:target="_blank"} that I submitted to Stanford.
My corresponding [teaching demo](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Va9IfW49JJkY_UNjH-XJIbsmb6PIHZs4bMIKkWK_Jjk/edit#slide=id.p){:target="_blank"} is representative of how I'd teach a lesson.

If you're interested in TA-ing for one of my courses, please feel free to reach out, since at Stanford (and most places) instructors get to pre-select their TAs.
I always like to share [some guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15VQWynIaDy42vuYOna7G1mKrQoeFY5NavKbKEAuAG2Q/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} with my TAs so that we're on the same page and so I can best support them!

#### Projects üìñ

Although I am not a principal investigator (PI, aka Faculty), it doesn't mean we can't build things together.
Here are some longer-term projects that I am thinking about, in no particular order of priority.
These involve more extended conversations, 1+ quarters of weekly effort, and depending on the project and timing, we may be able to arrange some [compensation](https://ctl.stanford.edu/find-teaching-grants){:target="_blank"} for your efforts.
If one of them sounds interesting to you, we can discuss it and see if it's something we can pursue together.
<span style="font-weight:500">If you have your own ideas, I am very interested in knowing how I can support you</span>.

- <span style="font-weight:500">Course development</span>. 
This can take a variety of forms, such as:
    - Developing an entirely new course.
    This not only requires the most effort, but also some convincing to the department that it is necessary.
    As we already have a lot of technical MSE courses, one course topic that particularly excites me is [data visualization](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264127519303065){:target="_blank"} and communication.
    - Redesign an existing course.
    This may still require significant effort, but it's an important consideration to continually update our courses to match societal developments.
    These courses may not have been offered for quite some time, such as [MATSCI 156](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=matsci156){:target="_blank"} (energy materials) or [MATSCI 166](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=matsci166){:target="_blank"} (materials informatics).
    - Creating learning modules.
    Ever taken a course and wished one of the topics could be explained better? 
    Maybe you encountered it again later in your career and heard a better explanation.
    Here's an opportunity to create some targeted materials that can enhance student learning, with the scope being up to you.
    It's similar to the previous bullet, but likely at a smaller scale.
- <span style="font-weight:500">Curriculum support</span>.
I envision this to be slightly different from the previous section because some enhancements aren't course-specific, but rather the MSE program as a whole.
These could include:
	- Additional support (workshops, resources, etc.) for a particular aspect of the MSE program, such as undergraduate Honors or Research.
	- Additional workshops and guides for a particular milestone, such as fellowship applications, the PhD qualifying exam, or primers/prerequisites for unfamiliar students.
	- Program restructuring (e.g., course requirements and sequencing) to better align with present/future trends in the field. 
	This will involve data collection and analysis (e.g., perhaps from alumni) and I'm interested to hear your thoughts on this topic.
- <span style="font-weight:500">Recruitment and Community</span>.
These two things go hand in hand. 
You can't just invite someone to the dance‚Äîyou gotta dance with them too.
	- How can we, in the wake of [the SFFA court rulings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_Fair_Admissions_v._Harvard){:target="_blank"}, continue to attract diverse individuals to MSE and broaden participation in STEM?
	- Why does a Stanford student choose the MSE Major? 
	Or perhaps even more illuminating: Why does a Stanford student _not_ choose the MSE Major?
	Gathering this data will greatly inform where to prioritize our efforts.
	- How can we foster collaborations and communications among students in the MSE community?
	What does it take for techniques that are successful in the classroom to have a lasting impact in the general setting?

I want to conclude this section by saying that <span style="font-weight:500">you can make an impact at any level</span>, whether you're a first-year undergraduate or fifth-year PhD student.
To give you some examples of what I've personally worked on:
- As an undergrad at Stanford, I took [MATSCI 142](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=matsci142){:target="_blank"} quantum mechanics with [Prof. Aaron Lindenberg](https://profiles.stanford.edu/aaron-lindenberg){:target="_blank"}.
I loved the course so much that I relearned the material by [writing a coursereader](https://github.com/enze-chen/mse_142_cr){:target="_blank"} for the class, which is still used today.
- As an undergrad at Stanford, I was the undergrad rep on the informal MATSCI Advisory Board, where we met to share our experiences and concerns to the Department.
It appears that these updates have been replaced by the regular Town Halls.
- As a TA at Stanford, I wrote a new section for the [CME 104](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=cme104+khayms){:target="_blank"} coursereader and combed through the CME [100](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=cme100+khayms){:target="_blank"}/104 coursereaders for typos, all of which [Vadim](https://profiles.stanford.edu/vadim-khayms){:target="_blank"} was happy to incorporate.
- As a TA at Berkeley, I applied for a [course improvement grant](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/grants/course-improvement-grant/){:target="_blank"} and created the inaugural in-class poster session for their materials characterization laboratory course.
- As a PhD student, I wrote a lot of curricula to teach materials informatics, some for [summer workshops](https://enze-chen.github.io/mi-book-2022/intro.html){:target="_blank"} and some for [MSE courses](https://enze-chen.github.io/mse104l/){:target="_blank"}, the latter of which I conducted a small educational study with institutional review board approval.
- As a PhD student, I was inspired by the Stanford MSE Colloquium Pizza Hour üçï (rip üíÄ) to lead "C<sup>3</sup>: Coffee, Cookies, and Community" at Berkeley MSE prior to each Thursday seminar, which I did for the entirety of my degree.

There are _many_ other members of the Stanford MSE community, past and present, who have contributed to the success of the department.
We look to _you_ for the future. ü´µüèº
