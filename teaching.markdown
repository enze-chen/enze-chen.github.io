I absolutely **love teaching** and I am excited to make an impact in MSE education in the future. üë®‚Äçüè´  
I also enjoy learning about research in STEM education, with a focus on curriculum design and learning sciences. üí°

### Research opportunities

**Undergraduate students!** If you are interested in research/mentorship, here are some things we can chat about:    

* I am in the process of redesigning the MSE 45/L: Properties of Materials/Lab course through a [universal design for learning (UDL)](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/){:target="_blank"} framework.
If you are interested in curriculum design and inclusive pedagogy, please reach out!
* If you are interested in learning more about research, computational materials science, graduate life, Work vs. Masters vs. PhD (hint: [all of the above]({% post_url 2020-10-15-bsmsphd %})), or anything else, my door (or Zoom room?) is always open.  



### UC Berkeley

#### Mentoring

In Summer 2021, I was fortunate to be involved with a [DEI effort from the Materials Sciences Division](https://www2.lbl.gov/msd/diversity/index.html){:target="_blank"} to give undergraduates exposure to graduate-level research and graduate school.
I was a co-mentor with my advisor Mark Asta for an MI module where we worked with six students to conduct data-driven discovery of high-Œ∫ dielectric materials.
The curriculum we developed for this summer program is open source [on GitHub Pages](https://enze-chen.github.io/mi-book-2021){:target="_blank"} and I will be presenting our use of Jupyter authoring tools at the [2021 MRS Fall Meeting](https://www.mrs.org/meetings-events/fall-meetings-exhibits/2021-mrs-fall-meeting/call-for-papers/detail/2021_mrs_fall_meeting/bi01/Symposium_BI01){:target="_blank"}!

[[video](https://youtu.be/nJc_vHdhGmI){:target="_blank"}]

In Summer 2022 we reprised our module for the same internship ([slightly different textbook](https://enze-chen.github.io/mi-book-2022){:target="_blank"}) and had a blast working with a new group of 5 students, this time in person! 
Moreover, I finally got around to writing up our curriculum design and the manuscript is in review at the [*Journal of Chemical Education*](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/jceda8){:target="_blank"}.


#### Teaching assistant and other

In Fall 2021, I was a GSI for Prof. [Lane Martin](https://mse.berkeley.edu/people_new/martin/){:target="_blank"}'s [MSE 45/L: Properties of Materials Laboratory](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2021-fall-matsci-45-001-lec-001){:target="_blank"} class.
It was my first in-person classroom experience after the hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic;
a little nervous, but we're all trying our best!
I followed that up as a GSI in Prof. [Andrew Minor](https://mse.berkeley.edu/people_new/minor/){:target="_blank"}'s [MSE 104: Materials characterization](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2022-spring-matsci-104-001-lec-001){:target="_blank"} class in Spring 2022.
It was a joy to teach an upper-division course and meet a lot of the MSE majors. 
I was particularly proud to work with the teaching team and the department staff to organize an in-class poster session for the students to showcase their final projects!

On my own time, I have also created several [computational MSE learning modules](https://github.com/enze-chen/learning_modules/){:target="_blank"} that use [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/){:target="_blank"} for interactive visualizations.
They have been used in Prof. [Andy Minor](https://aminor.mse.berkeley.edu/)'s Materials Characterization course and my research mentoring.


#### Extracurriculars

I was previously a volunteer Peer Advisor with the [Graduate Pathways to STEM](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/admissions/graduate-admissions/graduate-student-outreach/graduate-pathways-to-stem/){:target="_blank"} (GPS) program that promotes graduate school opportunities to underrepresented minorities (URMs).
I have also been a volunteer teacher for [Berkeley Splash](https://berkeley.learningu.org/){:target="_blank"} (high schoolers) and previously for [Bay Area Scientists in Schools](http://www.crscience.org/volunteers/aboutbasis){:target="_blank"} (3rd graders).


#### MSE Graduate Student Council

I currently serve as the Academic & Industry Liaison for the [MSE Graduate Student Council](http://msegsc.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}. In this role, I spearheaded:

* Organizing community building events, such as *C^3: Coffee, Cookies, and Community* before our weekly Thursday seminars.
* Hosting our student-nominated seminar speaker in Spring 2020: [Ju Li](http://li.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} from MIT.
* Organizing a [Exponent](https://www.exponent.com/){:target="_blank"} info session in Spring 2020.
* Curating [preliminary exam materials](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1IpYgjRKMYpQVmu84i3yQ_TgTvwVKhiR6){:target="_blank"} for future cohorts (requires a Berkeley account to access).
* Updating and expanding the External Funding Opportunities on the [graduate resouces page](https://mse.berkeley.edu/graduate-resources/){:target="_blank"} on our department website.
* Creating several resources for remote instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic:  
    * A [Zoom guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ETVVHGrWccp7gC6zYV0F4nFS6qkMO8jKiS_h66Undlo/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} for instructors and students.
    * A [YouTube tutorial for active learning](https://youtu.be/kFp7f4Uz2fI){:target="_blank"} with Zoom breakout rooms.
    * A [YouTube tutorial for problem-solving sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT6T8_uEOEA){:target="_blank"} with Zoom breakout rooms.
    * A student focus group to offer [a list of recommendations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bPhKet2K6E7-kKc8BeoiIfIYDjXgAleMYrXoQPhDOzc/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} for MSE faculty for online instruction.

### Professional experience

I worked as the first Instructional Designer at [Citrine Informatics](https://citrine.io){:target="_blank"} prior to starting my PhD. My manager was [Josh Tappan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtappan/){:target="_blank"}.
I was in charge of designing educational content around machine learning, materials science, and Citrine's software platform for a wide variety of audiences, including data scientists, materials engineers, and business managers.
In addition to developing a pedagogical framework for informatics education, I created many [open-source Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/learn-citrination){:target="_blank"} as instructional tools, and led a day-long workshop at the [Texas A&M Summer School on Computational Materials Science](https://cms3.tamu.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
Some of this material has been adapted for a similar [Programmatic Materials Informatics](https://citrineinformatics.github.io/ga-tech-workshop/index.html){:target="_blank"} workshop at Georgia Tech by my friend [Zach del Rosario](https://www.zdelrosario.com/){:target="_blank"}.

---------------------------------


### Stanford University

#### Stanford Splash

During my undergrad, I was extremely involved with [Stanford Splash](https://www.stanfordesp.org/){:target="_blank"}, an educational outreach organization that brings nearly 2000 middle school and high school students to campus to take classes designed and taught by over 300 Stanford students.
I also taught at 10 different programs and some of my course materials can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/enze-chen/splash_classes){:target="_blank"}.

#### Teaching assistant and other

During my last two quarters, I worked as a TA in two undergraduate math classes, both of which were taught by [Vadim Khayms](https://profiles.stanford.edu/vadim-khayms){:target="_blank"}. Some of the course materials I created can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/enze-chen/stanford_ta){:target="_blank"}.
* Spring 2018: CME 104 - Linear Algebra and Partial Differential Equations for Engineers. ~30 students.
* Fall 2018: CME 100 - Vector Calculus for Engineers. ~160 students.

I also wrote a [new coursereader](https://github.com/enze-chen/mse_142_cr){:target="_blank"} for the core undergraduate quantum mechanics class ([MATSCI 142](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=matsci142&collapse=){:target="_blank"}) taught by [Aaron Lindenberg](https://mse.stanford.edu/people/aaron-lindenberg){:target="_blank"}.
