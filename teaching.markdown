I absolutely <span style="font-weight:500">love teaching</span> and I am excited by the opportunity to help students succeed‚Äîacademically, professionally, and personally.
I also enjoy learning about research in STEM education, with a focus on curriculum design, informatics/AI education, and universal design for learning. üß†

#### Advising üí°

No matter how I design my courses, it doesn't change the fact that <span style="font-weight:500">the majority of your learning will take place outside of the classroom and often in conversation with others</span>.
I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of countless mentors who have dedicated their time to offer me advice and opportunities.
That's why I try to make myself as available as possible for students and my door will always be open for you, regardless of your educational background and affiliation.
Here are some examples of the things we can talk about; but even if I don't have answers to all of your questions, I can connect you with someone who does or at least help expand your views of what's possible.

- <span style="font-weight:500">Can you explain [this concept] to me?</span> 
Certainly, and I'll try to do a better job than [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/){:target="_blank"}!
I will expect these types of questions from my students, but even if you're not, I can give it a shot and I'm confident we'll work out a satisfying explanation together.
- <span style="font-weight:500">Should I [major in MSE](https://mse.stanford.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-program/major){:target="_blank"}?</span> 
What does it even mean [to be a "materials scientist?"](https://occamstypewriter.org/nicolaspaldin/2021/05/05/an-open-letter-to-students-of-materials-science-and-engineering/){:target="_blank"}
Let me try to convince you the answers are **yes!** and _everything_. üòÅ
- <span style="font-weight:500">What courses should I take?</span> 
How do I make a [four-year plan](https://ughb.stanford.edu/plans-program-sheets/program-sheets/program-sheets/program-sheets/program-sheets/program-sheets-0){:target="_blank"}? 
It can be daunting to have the next four years "figured out," so I'm happy to chat about options.
Hint: things never work out the way we expect, evident by [my own four-year plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qei_jYMdwKD7kmKV5YCM_0nhyDBxzsR0fvyDb2cAU0s/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.
- <span style="font-weight:500">Can I do research in MSE as an undergrad?</span> 
You're in luck! The MSE Department offers many [undergraduate research opportunities](https://mse.stanford.edu/UGresearch){:target="_blank"}, including the flagship [Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)](https://mse.stanford.edu/REU){:target="_blank"} and [Undergraduate Research Grants (URG)](https://mse.stanford.edu/URG){:target="_blank"} in Winter/Spring quarter.
Both are based on applications and we will try to match you to a research group with a good fit.
Both programs are great learning opportunities with a small stipend.
- <span style="font-weight:500">Can I do research with _you_?</span> 
I can serve as an informal mentor, but I cannot serve as your formal advisor. 
Luckily, our department has [excellent Faculty](https://mse.stanford.edu/people/faculty){:target="_blank"} who do impactful, interdisciplinary research that I'm happy to connect you with.
That being said, I am always thinking about [education-related projects](#projects-) and I welcome eager students who want to collaborate and make a lasting impact.
- <span style="font-weight:500">After graduation, should I work, do a Masters, or do a PhD?</span> 
[Should I do all of them?]({% post_url 2020-10-15-bsmsphd %}) 
Like all the other topics here, this is a personal decision and I'm happy to be a sounding board as you weigh your priorities.
- <span style="font-weight:500">Fellowships seem like a ton of work; is it worth applying for the [GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/){:target="_blank"}, [NDSEG](https://ndseg.org/){:target="_blank"}, [CSGF](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/){:target="_blank"}, etc.?</span>
<span style="font-weight:500">Absolutely</span>, [for so many reasons]({% post_url 2020-8-8-nsfgrfp %}).
Let's chat!
- And, if by some odd chance: Can you teach me how to use atomistic simulations to study planar defects? üòÇ
Why happily... never thought anyone would ask...

Of course, our conversation can extend beyond these topics and I look forward to chatting with you!

---------------------------------

#### Projects üìñ

Although I am not a principal investigator (PI, aka Faculty), it doesn't mean we can't build things together.
Here are some longer-term projects that I am thinking about, in no particular order of priority.
These involve more extended conversations, 1+ quarters of weekly effort, and depending on the project, we may be able to arrange some [compensation](https://ctl.stanford.edu/find-teaching-grants){:target="_blank"} for your efforts.
If one of them sounds interesting to you, we can discuss it and see if it's something we can pursue together.
If you have your own ideas, I'd also be interested in knowing how I can support you.

- <span style="font-weight:500">Course development</span>: 
This can take a variety of forms, such as:
    - Developing an entirely new course.
    This not only requires the most effort, but also some convincing to the department that it is necessary.
    As we already have a lot of technical MSE courses, one course topic that particularly excites me is on [data visualization](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264127519303065){:target="_blank"} and communication.
    - Redesign an existing course.
    This is one level down, but may require significant effort as it's a holistic consideration.
    These courses may not have been offered for quite some time, such as [MATSCI 156](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=matsci156){:target="_blank"} (energy materials) or [MATSCI 166](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=matsci166){:target="_blank"} (materials informatics).
    - Creating learning modules.
    Ever taken a course and wish one of the topics could be explained better? 
    Maybe you encountered it again later in your career and heard a better explanation.
    Or you wished that there could be a primer that covered the prerequisites for unfamiliar students.
    Here's an opportunity to create some targeted materials that can enhance student learning, with the scope being up to you.
    It's similar to the previous bullet, but at a smaller scale.
    - What I will say is that
