### STEM education
In addition to MSE, another passion of mine is STEM education, particularly curriculum design and learning theory. I was also actively engaged in teaching opportunities through teaching with [Stanford Splash](https://github.com/enze-chen/splash_classes){:target="_blank"}, writing a [**new coursereader**](https://github.com/enze-chen/mse_142_cr){:target="_blank"} for the core undergraduate quantum mechanics class ([MATSCI 142](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=matsci142&collapse=){:target="_blank"}), and working as a TA for hundreds of students in Vadim Khayms's [undergraduate math classes](https://github.com/enze-chen/stanford_ta){:target="_blank"} (CME 100 and CME 104).

Professionally, I worked as the first Instructional Designer at [Citrine Informatics](https://citrine.io){:target="_blank"} prior to starting my PhD. My manager was [Josh Tappan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtappan/){:target="_blank"}. I was in charge of designing educational content around machine learning, materials science, and Citrine's software platform for a wide variety of audiences, including data scientists, materials engineers, and business managers. In addition to developing a pedagogical framework for informatics education, I created many [**open-source** Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/learn-citrination) as instructional tools, and led a day-long workshop at the [Texas A&M Summer School on Computational Materials Science](https://cms3.tamu.edu/). Some of this material has been adapted for a similar [Programmatic Materials Informatics](https://citrineinformatics.github.io/ga-tech-workshop/index.html){:target="_blank"} workshop at Georgia Tech. 

I hope to continue exploring the field of education during my PhD and to continue developing my pedagogical skills. I have already created several [**computational MSE learning modules**](https://github.com/enze-chen/learning_modules/){:target="_blank"} that use Python and Jupyter notebooks for interactive visualizations. They will be adopted in the 2020-2021 school year in a few MSE courses.

I am also the Academic & Industry Liaison for the [MSE Graduate Student Council](http://msegsc.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"}. In this role, I have helped with:

* Organizing community building events, such as *C^3: Coffee, Cookies, and Community* before Thursday seminars.
* Hosting our student-nominated seminar speakers (Spring 2020: [Ju Li](http://li.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} from MIT).
* Curating [preliminary exam materials](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1IpYgjRKMYpQVmu84i3yQ_TgTvwVKhiR6){:target="_blank"} for future cohorts (requires a Berkeley account to access).
* Creating a [Zoom guide for instructors and students](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ETVVHGrWccp7gC6zYV0F4nFS6qkMO8jKiS_h66Undlo/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a [YouTube tutorial for active learning with Zoom breakout rooms](https://youtu.be/kFp7f4Uz2fI){:target="_blank"}.
* Organizing industry info sessions (Spring 2020: [Exponent](https://www.exponent.com/){:target="_blank"}).
